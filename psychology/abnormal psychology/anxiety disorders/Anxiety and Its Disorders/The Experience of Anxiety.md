# 1 - The Experience of Anxiety: Shadow of Intelligence of Specter of Death?

## The Shadow of Intelligence

- Howard Liddell claimed that anxiety accompanies intellectual activity as its shadow
- How can panic response be useful?
  - Defensive physical adjustments such as hot and cold spells, increased blood circulation, reduced saliva, fainting
- When in presence of a predator, most prey species will initially do fight/flight, then followed by a response similar to paralysis, but with a "waxy flexibility"
  - Look like they are playing dead: "tonic immobility"
  - Freezing prevents further attack and increases victim's chances for survival
- Tonic immobility may be seen in humans in instance of rape reactions where subjects feel paralyzed

## The Sound of the Wind

- Anxiety is not totally Darwinic: Threat seems to come from an urge to flee itself
- Threat is internal

## Terms and Meanings

- Early theorists based distinctions between fear and anxiety on presence of cues
  - Fear: specific, observable danger
  - Anxiety: diffuse, objectless apprehension
- Behavioral therapy assumed all anxiety has clear identifiable cues, so boundaries between "fear" and "anxiety" have become closer
- Terminology for anxiety is more varied: "fear" "dread" "phobia" "angst"
  - Notion of anxiety without an object
  - Apprehension about the future
  - When it has an object, prefer the word Freud preferre "fear"
- Root word "angh" refers to the concept of narrowness or constriction, better suited than "anxiety" which is sometimes used similarly to "concern"
- It has been suggested by Social Constructivists that anxiety can refer to many different cognitive/somatic points of reference from person to person

## Being and Preparing

- Philosophers find value in the experience of anxiety:
  - Kierkegaard: Anxiety's source is deep within individual, rooted in fear or nonexistence, nothingness
    - By confronting this fear one can discover essense of being
  - Rollo May: Anxiety is apprehension by a threat to some value individual holds essential to existence
  - Freud: angst can be cued by activation of theats to a child which are stored in memory
- Liddell's shadow of intelligence: experiments producing anxiety in animals
  - He theorized vigilance has positive consequences: vigilant anials seem to be conditioned or to learn more easily
  - Vigilant animals are concerned with the future and planning "What happens next?"
- Effective planning for future and enjoyment of past achievemnt are the mans by which human beings construct culture
- Capacity to experience anxiety and capacity to plan are two sides of the same coin
- Phsyical/Intellectual performance is driven and enhanced by anxiety
  - 1908: Yerkes/Dodson demonstrate this by showing that animal performance on a task was better if they were made a little anxious

## The Specter of Death

### The Neurotic Paradox

- Neurotic people sees actions that have unfavorable consequences, yet neuroticism persists
- Most people are aware that there is little or nothing to fear in their phobias
- But even forced exposure doesn't always resolve the paradox
- Freud: Neurotic anxiety originates from inner instinctual woish associated with reactivating infantile fear. This creates defense mechanisms
- Individuals learn to modulate anxiety to an unnoticeable form called "signal anxiety"
  - Not perceptible to person experienceing it
  - Just triggers a defense reaction - limited in intensity and duration, and associated with adaptive defenses
- When anxiety is noticeable, intense, distruptive or triggers self-defeating defense mechanisms it is pathological
- In Freud's thought, we confront infantile modes of psychological functioning
- Pathological anxiety emerges in connect with our deep instincts

### Mortality

- Sometimes severe anxiety can have consequences that in and of themselves result in physical destruction

### Cardiovascular Disease

- Greater mortality rate in patients with anxiety disorders, primarily due to cardiovascular disease and suicide, specifically in males
- Men with highest levels of phobic anxiety had higher risk for heart disease and sudden death

### Suicide

- Frequency of suicide in patients with anxiety disorders is equal to frequency of suicide in depression
- 20% of patients with panic disorder had made a suicide attempt at some point
- No suicidal risk exclusively to do with panic disorder, usually comorbid risks

### Anxiety and Substance Abuse/Dependence

- Substance dependency may be medicating anxiety disorders, especially social phobia and disabling agoraphobia
- Different patterns of alcohol use problems associated with specific anxiety disorders
- Patients with anxiety who also suffer from alcohol abuse generally have more severe anxiety
- Odds of developing comorbid anxiety disorder in context of existing alcoholism are 3.5 to 5x what they would be in absence of a disorder
- Anxiety and panic when medicated with alcohol result in ever-increasing downward self-destructive spiral
- Growing literature on use of cocaine and panic disorder
  - Related to both use of cocaine and abrupt stopping of heavy use

### Surgery

- "neurourgery" therapeutic procedures are also risky but can provide benefit when all other treatments fail

### Prevalence and Course

- Millions of individuals seek help for "anxiety" or "nervousness"
- Taxing to the primary health care system
- Large study to ascertain percentages of people with anxiety disorders(1969)
  - Total prevalnce of phobias: 7.7% , severe phobias: 0.02%
  - 0.06% of sample had agoraphobia
  - Most people, approaching 50%, presented with mild fears
- Phobias are prolonged: After developed, people have at least mildly for a lifetime
- Depression tends to remit whether treated or not, usually around 9 months
- Anxiety disorders tend to be chronic and remain present even if successfully treated
- Anxiety disorders represent single largest mental health problem in the country
- Very prevalent in primary care settings: 18% report panic disorder, GAD or anxiety descriptions
- Tend to diminish with increasing age

### The Human Costs of Anxiety Disorders

- Anxiety disorders account for about 31% of costs of mental health care
  - 22% mood disorders
  - 20% schizophrenia
- Elevated rates of financial dependence and unemployment, poor health
- Panic disorder patients are more likely to seek help than people with any other mental disorder: therefore enormous utilization of health care resources
- Health care costs for individuals with anxiety disorders are double than those without anxiety disorders
- Not treating a disorder is significantly more expensive than providing appropriate treatment

### Is Anxiety a Female Disorder?

- Some phobias are very female dominant: small insects/animals 90% female
- Females are twice as likely to experience anxiety disorders than males
- Depression is also a largely female disorder

### Anxiety Across Cultures

- Inuuit male: nervousness presented. Danish travelers to greenland observed conditions where Inuit hunters would experience sudden breathing difficulties and racing heartrate ("kayak angst")
- Expression of emotion is well known to be culturally determined
- Koro, Pa-leng, Kyol Goeu ("Sore Neck"), Heart Distress (Iran), "Voodoo Death, Shinkeishitshu", Ataque de Nervios
- Experience of anxiety exists in all cultures but articulated in culture-specific idioms
- Attempts to treat emotional disorders in China with Western pharmacological techniques are unsuccessful because patients believe causes are fully attributable to environmental factors
- Cross cultural, anxiety presents as different somatic symptoms
