# Limits

- lim f(x) = L :f(x) approaches L
- lim f(x) = L if x -> a from both sides a+ and a-.

__Continuity__

- If only continous on one side, 'left continous' or 'right continous'
- If x and y limits both exist but are not equal - `jump discontinuity`
- if x and y limits are equal but f(x) != lim x - `removable discontinuity`

- Continuousity can be added, subtracted, multiplied but not divided where a = 0.
- sin cos, line functions are continous but NOT tangent or any point where 1/x x = 0.
- f(x) may = Y but lim f(x) could be Y or any other number, or not a limit

- f is continous at x = a if f(x) = a

- If f,g is continuous, product/sum/diff is equally continuous
- All polynomials are continuous, cosx sinx, exponential functions  


- if h(x) = f(g(x))
- h(x) -> h(a) -> continuous everywhere

- Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)
  -  If f is continuous on (a,b), at least one point between f(a) and f(b) such that f(c) = M. (intersects).
- Using the IVT

__Limits of quotients__

- Limit Law for Division
  - M=0, L!= 0, lim f(x)/g(x) DNE
- when f(x)/g(x) when f(x) and g(x) --> does not tell you how big/small the limit is
- Division Limit Law (`lim f(x)/g(x)`)
  - if g(x) != 0 -> f(x)/g(x)
  - if ()
  if f(x) and g(x) = 0......
    - If it can be factored w/ algebra functions... --> factor out!
    - If factored down but still gets  divided by zero... --> DNE

__Infinite Limits__

- + infinity : goes up to infinity
- - infinity : goes down to - infinity
- If lim+ and lim- are equal, can say lim is + or neg infinity
-
