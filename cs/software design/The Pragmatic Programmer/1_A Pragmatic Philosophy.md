# 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

 Pragmatic programming stems from a philosophy of pragmatic thinking. Some principles:

##  __1. Cat Ate my Source Code__
- Do personal best, analyze situation for risks that are beyond your control
- Do not take on responsibility for an impossible situation
  - Make call based on your judgement
- You will be held accountable for outcome
- Admit mistakes honestly & offer options
  - Before approaching someone with bad news, run through conversation in head
  - Explain what can be done to salvage
    - Refactoring, Prototyping, Testing, Automating

## __2. Software Entropy__
- Analogy: "One Broken Window"
- Don't leave broken windows unrepaired, fix as soon as it is discovered
  - If no time, take action to prevent further damage
- If you are on a team where code is pristine, you especially won't want to be the one to make a mess!

## __3. Stone Soup & Boiled Frogs__
- Analogy: Stone soup fable
- Sometimes you know what needs to be done, but other people have "start-up gatigue". 
- Work out what you can reasonably ask for, show people how it could develop, they will start to rally
- As a maintainer of project, make sure that code isn't getting bigger and worse - review big picture

## __4. Good Enough Software__
- Discipline yourself to write software that's good enough
- Involve users in their opinions: scope and quality should be specified as part of system
- Great work today is better than perfect tomorrow
  - Feedback helps eventual solution
- Know when to stop
- Consider modularization in software commercially*

## __5. Your Knowledge Portfolio__
- Knowledge becomes out of date as new langs, techniques, envs are developed
- Similar to maintaining financial portfolio
  - Invest regularly
  - Diversify
  - Balance between conservative & high risk/high reward
  - Buy low, sell high (emerging tech)
  - Review, rebalance
- Suggestions:
  - Learn 1 new lang a year
  - Read a tech book every quarter, take classes, user groups
  - Try diff environments - mac, linux, windows
  - Subscribe to trade mags, newsgroup, etc
  - Talk to other people to build network
  - Think critically about knowledge

## __6. Communicate__
- Know what you want to say, plan strategies for ommunicating
- Understand needs of audience, consider timing, style of delivery, make it look good, involve audience
- Listen to people, ask questions, have them summarize
- Always respond to emails and voicemails
