# 7. Before the Project

## __36. The Requirements Pit__

- Requirements are rarely on the surface
- Digging for REquirements
  - Statement of something that needs to be accomplished
  - Requirements/Policy/Implementation can get blurred
  - Discover why users do a thing, not just the way they currently do it
    - Development solves a business problem
- Documenting Requirements
  - Use cases to capture requirements
    - Goal driven nature
  - Using a formal template helps you make sure you include all information you need in a use case
    - Pay attention to hierarchal structuring of use caases
  - Use case diagrams: Use whatever methods capture requirements best
  - Overspecifying: Good requirements remain abstract
  - Requirements are `need`, not design or UI
  - Just one more: Point out each feature's impact on the schedule to project
  - Glossary: Maintain one place that defines all specific terms
  - Get the word out: Physical documentation

## __37. Solving Impossible Puzzles__

- Don't try simple thing over and over again, find the real constraints
- Degrees of freedom: Recognize all possible avenues, id the most restrictive constraints, then fit remaining constraints within them
- There must be an easier way: sometimes a reinterpretation of problem makes a whole set of problems go away

## __38. Not until You're Ready__

- Let your instinct give you pause
- Good Judgement or Procrastination? Start with prototyping 

## __39. The Specification Trap__

- Program specification: Process of taking a requirement and reducing it down to a point where programmer skill can take over
- Agreement with user
- Doesn't need to be extremely detailed
- View requirements gathering, design and implementation as facets of the same process
  - Each piece should not be in isolation, should flow into the next

## __40. Circles and Arrows__

- Formal Techniques and Methods will be disappointing if not used in context of dev practices
  - Diagrams are meaningless to end users
  - Encourage specialization, which can isolate devs
  - Doesn't help with generating dynamic, adaptable systems
- Do Methods Pay off? Probably overblown. There is an adoption cost of adopting new tools and methods
- Should we use formal methods? Yes but don't become a slave to methodology
