# 2.2 Integer Representations

## 2.2.1 Integral Data Types
- Data that represents finite ranges of integers
- Each type specifies a sie with keyword `char`, `short`, `long`, plus `unsigned`, `signed`
- Ranges are not symmetrical: range of neg nums extends 1 further than positive

## 2.2.2 One's Complement Encoding
- For negative numbers: flip all the bits
- Bit adding does work

## 2.2.3 Two's Complement Encodings **
- Most common computer rep of signed numbers = two's complement form
- Most significant bit of the word has negative weight (left most)
  - Also called the `sign bit`
- When sign bit is set to 1 = neg
- When set to 0 = non negative
- Can have a negative 0
- Bit adding does not work


## 2.2.4 Converstions between signed and unsigned
- C allows casting between different numerica data types
- Casting keeps bit values identical but changes how the bits are interpreted
- Changes numeric value but not bit representation

## 2.2.5 Signed versus Unsigned in C
- Almost all machines use two's complement signed numbers
- Most nums are signed by default

## 2.2.6 Expanding the Bit Representation fo a Number
- Converting between integers with different word sizes while retaining same numeric value
- Not always possible when destination data type is too smal, but should always be possible from a smaller to larger data type
- Add leading zeroes to the reprentation - `zero extension`
- For two's complement number to a larger data type - `sign extension` - adding copies of the most significant bit to the representation

## 2.2.7 Truncating Numbers
