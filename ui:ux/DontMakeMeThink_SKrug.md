# Don't Make Me Think - Steve Krug


## Ch.1 - Don't Make Me Think

- "Don't make me think"
    - When looking at a page that doesn't make you think - thought balloons say: "ok there's the _  and that's a _ and there's the thing i want"
    - When looking at a page that makes you think all thought balloons have question marks over them.
        - "where do i start?"
        - "can i click on that?"
        - "is that the navigation?"

- Your job is to get rid of the question marks
- Questions add to cognitive workload - distracting from task at hand
- Self-Evident vs. Self-Explanatory
    - You can't always make everything self-evident but make it at least self-explanatory.
- Why is it important?
    - Like having good lighting - makes everything seem better.
    - Pages have to work their magic at a glance, best way is to create pages that are self-evident or self-explanatory.


## Ch.2 - How We Really Use the Web

- People mostly just GLANCE at each new page, scan SOME text, then click on first link that catches their interest

- #1: We don't read pages. We scan them.
    - Focus on words or phrases that match task at hand or our interests
    - Just a fraction of what's there

- #2: We don't make optimal choices, we "satisfice"
    - satisfice : first reasonable option
    - First reasonable plan that comes to mind & then scans for possible problems => plan of action

- #3: We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.
    - People use things all the time without understanding why they work.
    - It's not important to them / if it works they stick to it

- 'If your audience is going to act like you're designing billboards, then design great billboards.'

## Ch.3 - Billboard Design 101 

- Designed for scanning, not reading

- Take advantage of conventions
    - Follow existing conventions:
        - In web, conventions already exist: 
            - Logo top left
            - Navigation: top or left side
        - Where things located/How Things Work/How Things Look: Be aware of conventions already in place
    - When purposefully replacing conventions, make sure replacements are a) clear and explanatory or b) adds so much value it's worth a small learning curve.
    - Be creative/innovative but make sure it's still useable
    - Consistency / Clarity: Clarity Trumps Consistency

- Create Effective Visual Hierarchies
    - Appearance of things on the page accurately portrays the relationships between things on the page:
        - Which things are most important?
        - Which things are similar?
        - Which things are part of other things?
        
    - More important = more prominant
        - larger/bolder/distinctive color, more white space, nearer top of page
    - Related logically = related visually
        - Grouping under same heading
        - Same visual style
        - Put in clearly defined area

    - Nesting shows what's part of what
    - Visual Hierarchies preprocess a page for us.

- Break up Pages into Clearly Defined Areas
- Make it Obvious what is clickable
    - Shape/Location/zaFormatting
    - Stick to one color for all text links or make sure that shape/location identify them as clickable

- Keep Noise down to a dull roar

    - Shouting: Lots of things clamoring for your attention
    - Disorganization: random things everywhere - shows designer doesn't know how to use grids to align elements
    - Clutter: Too much stuff
    - Start with assumption everything is visual noise and remove anything that's not making a big contribution
za
- Format Text to Support Scanning
    - Plenty of headings
    - If >1 heading, make sure there's an obvious visual distinction
    - Don't let headings float: Make sure they're closer to the section they introduce than the sections they follow
    - Keep paragraphs short
    - Use bulleted lists: Anything that can be a bulleted list should be
    - Highlight Key Terms
        - "Letting Go Of The Words" (Ginny Redish)
        

## Ch. 4 - Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

- Why users like mindless choices
    - don't think about # of clicks - instead - amount of thought/uncertainty about whether right choice
    - each click should be painless + feel like they are on the right trak
    - "Scent of Information"

- Forms That Work - Designing Web Forms For Useability

- When Guidance Is required
    - Should be :
        - brief
        - timely
        - unavoidable


## Ch. 5 Omit words

- The art of not writing for the web
    - Get rid of half of words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left

- Reduces noise level
- Makes useful content more prominent
- Makes pages shorter

- Things to remove / shorten:
    - Happy Talk
    - Instructions


## Ch. 6 Street signs and Breadcrumbs

Designing Navigation

- Web Navigation 101

   - Trying to find something
   - Decide whether to ask first or browse first
   - (asking in web = search bar)
     - some ppl  are search-dominant some are link-dominant
- Oddities of Web Space:
     - No sense of scale
      - No sense of direction/location
- Overlooked Purposes of Navigation
     - Tells us what's here
     - Tells how to use the site
    - Gives confidence in the people who built it
- Web conventions
    - Site ID upper left corder
    - Utilities on top: underneath is sections
    - Categories on Left
    - Persistent Navigation: 4 elements:
        - Site ID
            - We expect to see Site ID on top of the page - near the upper left corner
            - Should look like a logo: distinctive
        - Sections
            - Primary Navigation: Links to main sections of site
                - Some sites also include display secondary navigation
        - Utilities
            - Important elements that are not part of content hierarchy
            - Less prominent than sections
                - About Us  / Archives / Checkout / Contact Us / Customer Service / Etc
                - Less frequently used leftovers should be place in footer
        - Search
            - Avoid fancy wording: use "Search"
            - Instructions not necessary
            - Add options if searching specific areas but try to avoid: push options onto search results instead
    - Navigation can be removed for 'form' pages: use minimal version instead
- Page Names
   - Every page needs a name
   - Needs to be in the right place: frames content unique to the page
   - Name should be prominent
   - Name needs to match what I clicked
- "You are Here"
    - Current locations should be highlighted or marked to show where you are.
    - Shouldn't be subtle
    - Breadcrumbs
        - Put them at the top
        - Use > Between Levels
        - Boldface last item
    - Tabs
        - Self Evident
        - Hard to Miss
        - Slick
        - Active tabs need to contrast
        - Should physically connect with space below
- Test The Navigation
    - As quickly as possible try to find each of these items from any page on the site:
        -ID, Page Name, Sections, Local Navigation, You Are Here Indicators, Search



## Ch. 7 The Big Bang Theory of Web Design

All things home page has to accomodate:
    - Site identity
    - Site Hierarchy
    - Search
    - Teases
    - Content promos / Feature promos
    - Timely content
    - Deals
    - Shortcuts
    - Registration
    - Show me what I'm looking for
    - Let me find new stuff
    - Show me where to start
    - Establish credibility & trust

- Designing a home page involves compromise
    - But make sure you convey the big picture
        - What is this?
        - What can I do here?
        - What do they have here?
        - Why should I be here and not somewhere else

- These questions have to be answered clearly, at a glance
- Four excuses for not spelling out the big picture:
    - "It's obvious
    - "We shouldn't explain it more than once"
    - "Anyone who needs our site will know what it is"
    - That's what our advertising is for
- How to get the message across
    - The tagline: next to site ID, description of site
    - Welcome blurb: quick description of site or company
    - "Learn more"
    - Use as much space as necessary, but don't use any more space than necessary
    - Don't use a mission statement as a welcome blurb
    - One of the most important things to test 

- Taglines
    - clear & informative
    - just long enough (6-8 words)
    - convey differentiation & benefit
    -AD taglines = generic

- Where do I start?
    - should be albe to say: here's where to start if I want to search
    - Here's where to start if I want to browse
    - Here's where to start if I want to smample the best stuff

## Ch. 8: The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends

- You will inevitably run into problems in teams:
    - Designer/Developer/CEO/Project Manager
- Question isnt about how these individuals like th echoices, question is do the choices create a good experience for the people likely to use the site
- TESTING is the answer !

## Ch. 9: Usabilit Testing on 10 Centers a Day

- KEEP TESTING SIMPLE - So you do enough of it
- Focus Groups vs Usability Tests
    - small group talks about products/past opinions/new concepts
    - usability tests: watch one person try to use something
- Focus groups should be use before designing/building, usabilility throughout entire process

- If you want a great site, you've got to test
- Testing one user is 100% better than 0
- Testing one user early is better than testing 50 near the end
- "DIY" Testing
    - 3 participants, continual participation, once every month, recruit loosely, on site, half day
- How to choose participants?
    - Recruit loosely, grade on a curve
- Who should do the testing?
    - "facilitator", calm, empathetic, a good listener
- Who should observe?
    - As many people as possible
- Observers write down the 3 most serious usability problems they noticed for a debriefing
- Choose tasks to test
- Debriefing: Deciding what to fix
    - Focus ruthlessly on fixing the most serious problems first
        - Create an ordered list
        - Create a separate list of low-hanging fruit
        - Resist urge to add things
        - Take "new feature" requests with a grain of salt
        - Ignore "kayak" problems
