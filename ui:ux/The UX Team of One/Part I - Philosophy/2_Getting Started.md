# 2 - Getting Started

## Get to Know the UX Toolkit

- Many models have been created to illustrate UX process and how it fits with other business processes
- While there's no certified process that all UX designers follow, there are still a relatively standard set of activities and deliverables
- Teams of one use many of these methods, just sometimes in less depth or without putting so many together into a full plan
- Helpful to start with understanding of full roster of options
- List of activities that may take place:
  - Discovery: Figuring out where you stand and what you need to do
    - Interviews with Stakeholders
    - SWOT (Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis
    - Requirements Gathering
  - Strategy: Establishing a vision for target UX to design products that are coherent
    - Design Principles
    - Vision Artifacts
    - Roadmaps
  - User Research: Learning about who users are and their motivations
    - Primary User Research: Learning from USers firsthand
    - Secondary User Research: Revieweing an aggregate of third party research
    - Personas, Mental Models, USer Stories: Documents that synthesize what you've learned about users
  - Design: Envisioning and specifying how a user will encounter a product or service from moment to moment
    - Information Architecture/Site Map
    - Process and Task Diagrams
    - Wireframes
    - Design Comps
    - Detailed Specifications: How prouct adapts in response to user interaction, how to handle error condiditons
    - Style and Pattern guides
    - Prototypes
  - Implementation: Ensuring design works for users and that it is implemented according to plan
    - Usability Testing
    - Implementation Oversight
    - Metrics/Analytics Tracking
- You can get a sense of boundaries of work by creating a one page sumary of services you provide- offering card

## Establish a Point of View on the Work to Be Done

- Have a clear picture of what work needs to be done and how to best contribute to it
- You can infuse UX philosophy into work you're currently doing
- Recommenations for crossover roles:
  - Find the low hanging fruit
  - Make a plan
  - Bypassing Objections:Provide two alternatives for how to go about the change instead of acquiesing

## Get to Know Your Users

- After developing a rough plan, next step should be to get firsthand experience with users
- Figure out what you know and what you don't: Learn how to gather available user data and use as a tool to guide your work
- Guerrila research: there are lightweight ways to connect with and put designs in front of actual users

## Start Designing

- Challenge is for UX professionals to understand user needs well enough to look past basic solutions and discover elegant ones
- Some tools of classically trained designers can come in handy:
  - Sketch your ideas
  - Enlist colleagues to generate design ideas
  - Learn from other successful products

## If you Only Do One Thing

- First, establish a point of view on where to start
- Then figure out a sensible process with a balance between research and design
- Most important concept: Actually talk to users

## A typical UX Team of One Job Description

- Employers are often confused about the relationship between visual design and UX design.
