# 3 - Building Support For Your Work

- It can be difficult to get people to stand behind the UX approach, esp when it butts against executive fiat or time and budget
- Orgs that are new to UX can show an ebb and flow of commitmet that leaves teams with more support sometimes, sometimes less
- Build trust, set expectations and show progress against them to deal with people and organizational issues that can influence how successful your work is

## Principles Over Process

- Principles can keep people anchored more than process
- A way to articulate a vision for what a user-centered approach should entail
- Can apply to how you work, not just what you make

## Invite People In

- Openness and friendliness can go a long way - cultivate advocates for UX

## Make Things Together

- You can help break conversatwional cycle and foster constructive evolution of shared visions by modeling behaviors like sketching, whiteboarding, and drawing things out

## Truly Listen

- Job of teams of one: Create a design solution that reconciles tensions
- Be interested in other people's viewpoints and engaged to understand where they're coming from

## Know When It's Good Enough

- Work is never really done
- Commit yourself to the idea that it will be imperfect and others will have good ideas for how to improve it
- You will start to get a feel for whta "good enough" looks like

## Dealing With People Issues

- interview the team about how they want to engage with UX. People are resources. Involve 1:1 meeting with key people to educate you as to their perspectives on the project
- Build an informal UX network
- Ask others to particpate: invite cross functional team collaborate on UX and generative design projects
- Arrange pre-meetings to avoid a "big reveal": help you get people to commit their support for your approach prior to going in for a big reveal
  - Gives colleagues time and space to think about proposed designs and establish a point of view
- Use relateable language: use plain ways to describe what you're attempting to do

## Dealing with Organizational Isses

- UX people tend to provide a holistic view that can actually be rare
- Offer to visualize requirements: Help others visually convey what they have in mind and tease out their ieas
- Help others see UX impact: MAke it clear how UX changes the established process
- Play nicely with vendors
  - Get invited to their meetings
  - Work iwth them rather than against them
  - Know that thye don't do all the work
- Turn rubber stamp into opportunity
  - Do guerrila user research to give teams an understand ing of what needs to be improved
- Develop Case Studies
  - Wrap up past projects into a tidy story.

## Reponses to Common Objections

- It's just web design right?
  - USer needs can impact product at many levels and impact what is included, how things are presented and how well it integrates with other touchpoints
- But we already do market research
  - User-centered research is design research: differs from market research in approach and intent
  - Identifying how best to achieve what people want: what versus how
  - Develop insight into why people do what they do an to spark ideas for how products can meet unmet needs
- UX Is too expensive
  - Good UX prevents reworkds
- Takes too much time
  - UX can actually help rapidly prototype, test and evolve the product esign

## If you Only Do One Thing

- Think about the principles at the start: invite Non-UX people into the process. Remember design is an iterative process that takes time to get right
