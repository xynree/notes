# 2 - Designing your design system

## Who should be involved

- Choosing the right team model
  - Solitary: "Overlord" rules the design system
    - "Overlord" can become bottleneck to completion of many tasks
  - Centralized: Single team maintains the design system as their full time job
    - Keeps system well maintained, but less connected to customer needs
  - Federated model: Team members from across company come together to work on the system
    - Can be quite busy already
  - Many teams are moving away from solitary to centralized or federated models - better for scaling
  - Design system is a product so staff it like a product instead of a project - People should be committed to maintaining and evolving it
- Interviewing customers
  - Interview users - who will be using design system and how will they use it
  - Executives, leaders, management
  - Two types of interface inventories to be created:
    - Inventory of visual attributes (spacing, color, typography)
    - Inventory of each UI element

## Creating a visual inventory

- Conduct a visual audit to see what can be merged or removed
  
- Creating a visual design language
  - Fundamental elements:
    - Colors
    - Typography (size, leading, typesface, etc)
    - Spacing (margins, padding, position, border)
    - Images (icons,illustrations)
    - Visual form (deph, elevation, shadows, rounded corners)
    - Motion/Sound
- Design tokens
  - Subatomic foundation of design system implementation
  - Name value pairs: SPACING: 1rem

__Colors__

- 1-3 primaries that represent your brand
- Neutrals for general UI backgrounds and borders (usually gray)
- State colors
- Helps with wayfinding
- Can include a range of tints and shades of color
