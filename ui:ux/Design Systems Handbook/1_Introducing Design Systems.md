# Introducing Design Systems

- 1968 NATO conference - component based development: speeds up programmer potential by making code reusable
- Design struggles to scale with applications it supports because of its bespoke nature
- Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reuseable

## Scaling Deesign with Systems Thinking

- Design is scaling: Design team is growing, design embedded in teams throughout the company, key role in all products on platforms
-

### Standards: Defining and adhering to standards creates understanding

- Encompass both design and development:
  - Naming conventions
  - Accessibility requirements
  - File structure
  - Visual Language - purpose and style of color, shape icons, type, space, motion
- Without standards, decisions become arbitrary and difficult to critique. Doesnot scale

### Components

- Portions of reuseable code
- More reuseable - less needed to maintain, easier to scale

## The Value of Design Systems

### Scale design

- Shared source of truth - place to reference official patterns and styles
- Static artifacts: design mocks or desgin system sites (Storybook)
- Documents all aspects of system including components, guidelines, UX best practices

### Manage your debt

- Using a design system helps keep design and ocde overhead low

### Design consistently

- Standardized components = predictable and easy to understand application
  - Prototype  faster
  - Improve useability
  - Build in accessibility

## Myths of design systems

- too limiting = designers often create custom solutions. New solutions can be created and fed back into system
- loss of creativity - components of design systems are interdependent
- one and done - design system requires ongoing maintance and improvements
