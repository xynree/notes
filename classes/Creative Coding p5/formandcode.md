# Form & Code 


1- What is Code?

- The Algorithm - series of instructions/procedure/program
    - Four qualities:
        - many ways to write an algorithm
        - requires assumptions
        - includes decisions
        - complex algorithms broken down into modular pieces
        - Example of an Algorithm: Sol LeWitt's 'Proposal for a Wall Drawing, Information Show' 1970

- Procedural Literacy
    - "Ability to read and write processes / engage with precedural representation" [^1]
        - Programming as communication and interaction with symobls
        - Syntax structures what is possible within a specific language
        - Different programing languages encourage programmers to think about work through constraints of languages
            - EX: BASIC/LOGO: Basic uses coordinate systems, while LOGO uses only angles(directing turtle on screen). BASIC promotes objectivity, LOGO promotes explotation.
            - Max, Pure Data, vvvv : influenced by patch cables attached to analog synthesizers. 

- Code and the Art2 - Form and Computers 2 - Form and Computers   s
    - Code developed in 1940's for science/engineering
    - Some experimentation happened in 50's/60's with software & themes
        - Cybernetic Serendipty, Insitute of Contemporary Arts in London 1968
        - Information, MoMA 1970
        - Software -  Information Technology: Its New Meaning for Art - Jewish Museum NY 1970
            - Hans Haacke - "Visitor's Profile" - profiled musuem patrons as art critique
            - Les Levine: "systems Burn-off X Residual Software" - photographs discussed as "software" - "All activities which have no connection with object or mass are software"
        - Artists/Musicians: Mel Bochner, John Cage, Allan Kaprow, Sol LeWitt, Yoko Ono, La Monte Young - wrote instructions and created diagrams as a form of art.
        - Programs started being made to be used to make art:
            - 1963 Bell Laboratories: Kenneth C. Knowlton 'BELFLIX' - a program for making animation used to create early computer film.
            - 1966 "Permutations" film: John Whitney Sr. using GRAF (programming library developed by Dr. Jack Citron from IBM).
            - Both built on language "Fortran".
            - 1980's: personal computers~ Hypertalk (Programming Language for Hypercard), Lingo

- Why Code?
    - use of software in arts:
        - Production: Computer used to produce a preconcieved form
        - Conception: Computer participates in development of form
    - Reduces amount of time for complex repetitive composition
    - Being able to develop new art software
    - New media = new languages with new/unique powers of expression (Marshall McLuhan)



2 - Form and Computers  

Drawing with Computers
- 1963 Ivan Sutherland: GUI Sketchpad

Controlling F'orm
- Computers rely on specifications
    - Coordinates
    - Shape (Raster/Vector graphics, 3d)
    - Color (additive => R+G+B = White

- Early images printed on plotter
- 1990's first laser printers
- Inkjet Printers allow printing on diverse mediums
- Fabrication
    - Laser cutter, CNC milling, other 3d 

3 - Repeat
    
    - Computers are great at repitition
    - Repitition choreographs eye movement
    - Op Art Movement
        - Many relied on use of algorithms
        - Warhol: repition makes subject a product
    - Rhythm in time & Music/ Film
        - Perception through " subtle/violent acts of repition"(p.40)
    - Modularity
        - A few basic shapes that have been arranged/blended together
        - reduces cost
        - building projects made this way
    - All visual patterns are composed of algorithms
    - Recursion
        - Function that references itself

4 - Transform

- Transformation: Manipulating a preexisting form to create something new
    - Change in Viewer's relationship to an Object
    - Transformation that makes reference to exissting symbols/schemes emphasizes emotional connection
        - Jasper Johns 'Three Flags' 1958

- Geometric Transformation
    - Digital transformtion makes unfeasible transformations possible
        - Robert Lazzarini Skull Scultures
            - anamorphosis (Hans Holbein)
        - Animation Tweening
            - Greg Lynn (architect)
            - Merce Cunninghan (dance choreographer) 
        - code => inspiration & create unimaginable forms

- Numerical Transform
    - Transposing an image to pixel values & transforming them weakens connection between image and the transformed piece.
        - Kenneth C Knowlton / Leon Harmon "Mural"
        - Growth and Form - D'Arcy Wentworth Thompsno
        - Plotting forms numerically/mathematically makes one able to see changes

- Transcoding
    - Converting two forms from one to other (jpeg -> png)
        - Rafel Lozano- Hemmer: 'Amodal Suspension'
        - Max MSP

- Transformation Techiques
- Image Averaging
    - Calculates median color or brightness - reassembles into composites
        - 100 Special Momens - Jason Salavon
- Slit Scanning
    - Transforms frames of a video into an image
        - Douglas Trumbull 2001: A Space Odyssey Scene
        - We interrupt your regularly scheduled program - Osman Khan & Daniel Sauter
- Collage
    - Digital + classic collage techniques
        - Untitled (Tom Friedman)
        - net.art generator Series 'Flowers' - Cornelia Sollfrank
        - Untitled V (James Paterson)
