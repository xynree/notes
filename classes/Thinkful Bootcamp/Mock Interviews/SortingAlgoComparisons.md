# How to Choose a Sorting Algorithm

Runtime Complexity: Worst to Best:

`O(n!)`: Factorial time multiplies all positive integers less than itself (Permutations)

Exponential `O(C^n)` : Calculations double every time as input grows (Fibonacci)

Cubic `O(n^3)`: 

Quadratic `O(n^2)` : Nested loop (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort)

Linearithmic `O(n log n)` : (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

Linear `O(n)` : Takes proportionally longer to complete as input grow

Logarithmic `O(log n) `: Statment is run by a log percentage (Binary Search)

Constant `O(1)` : Will always run statement a constant # of times (Algorithm, Map Get)

## Runtime Complexity:
- Efficiency as size of input grows larger:
O(n^2), O(n log n)
- Consider average, best and worse case efficiency

## Space Complexity
- Storage space required
  - Sorted in place or needs more space?

## Stability
- Does it preserve order of elements with equal values?
