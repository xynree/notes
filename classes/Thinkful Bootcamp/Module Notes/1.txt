1. I'm taking this program because I wanted the structure of a program to get me job ready for this stressful career switch in my life.

2. When I become more well rounded in coding I can see myself landing a career that is financially stable and fulfilling.

3. I want a career that I can work at remotely and have time to pursue my other passions. I want a job I'm genuinely invested in and I want to be a part of building things that are interesting and helpful to others.
