# 14: Testing Basics

# 14.2 - Test-Driven Dev

    - Happy Path: default scenario for using a function, with no edge cases or error conditions
    - TDD: first determining what you want your code to do and writing tests that your code will need to pass, and then writing code after
    - Test: Code that checks whether some other code works as intended

Why does it benefit the dev?
    - helps understand requirements for function
    - helps relax when code doesn't work
    - helps to refactor and improve code

Process for TDD:
    - Determine inputs, outputs, and functio name
    - Determine happy path: clearly stating function's purpose
    - Write smallest test possible
    - Write code to make the test pass
    - Repeat above, updating test to chec for next step
    - Consider alternative cases
    - Repat writing tests with alt cases

All tests have 3 phases:
    - Setup: prepare both input and oputput data
    - Run: feet input data to function to collect results
    - Check : compare actual to expected


# 14.3 - Unit Testing with Mocha&  Chai

- Unit Test: test that checks a small piece of code (single function)
- Testing framework: Program that auto runs the tests
- Assertion Library: tool that helps check for equality between actual/expected outputs

- Building a test (Video)

- Setup
    - module.export the function
    - move main.js into src
    - npm init -y
    - in package. json: scripts -> test- > mocha tests
    - yard add --save-dev mocha chai
    - Test files have name name.test.js: put into test file
- Writing Test
    - const expect = require("chai).expect;
    - const avgScore = require(../src/main")
    - describe("name", () => {
    
    it("desired function info string", () => {

    const input = []
    const expected = 9.3'
    const actual = avgScore(input)
    expect(actual).to.equal(expected)

    })

    - use npm test to use


- Mocha : testing framework
- Chai: Assertion Library

# 14.4 - More With Chai

- different expect() methods can be used to test code
- to.be.a() method
    - checks datatypes:
        - expect("Score").to.be.a("string");
- to.be.an("object")
- Remove extraneous checks: actual = expected will cover tobea "string"
- to equal() method vs to.eql() method
    - to.equal() can mess up when 2 objects are different objects in memory
    - to.eql() checks for deep equality: checks contents of arrays/objects to see if they are the same
- more expect()methods
    - expect('').to.be.empty
        - do not use to.not.be.empty
    - include()
        - expect('foobar').to.include('foo')
    -  lengthOf()
        - expect([1,2,3]).to.have.lengthOf(2, "custom error message when fails")j
    - true
        - expect(true).to.be.true

# 14.5 - Coverage

    - Code coverage tools: look at individaul lines, functions, and paths that code can take and comparing those to what you test

    - nyc package
        - test: "nyc --reporter=text mocha test"
        - Stmts: whether each individual statement of code was executed by tests
        - Branch: whether each if/else branch was executed by tests
        - Funcs: whether or not each function executed
        - Lines: whether each of line of cojde executed by tests

    - nyc builds you a .nyc_output folder as well
