# 41: Connecting It All

- CORS: specify which websites can access API + which HTTP methods can be used
- Same origin policy:
  - Web Browser allows scripts to access data at different URL if web page and  URL have same origin
    - https://domain.com

- Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows web page from one origin to access resource at other origin
- Origin header to request:
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * or one origin` (only * or 1 origin) 
- Browser checks `Origin` is sent with cross-origin request
- Browser checks Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in response

```js
const cors = require("cors")
.get(cors(), controller.list)
```
- cors middleware `cors()` enables cors for every origin

- simple requests/ preflight requests
  - GET/POST/Content-Type: application/multipart,text/plain : Simple Request
  - All others: preflight request
  - Preflight requests can use any HTTP methods

- Preflight requests ask for permission. Uses `OPTIONS` method with headers:
  - `Access-Control-REquest-Method` set to method of request
  - `Access-Control-REquest-Header` set to list of header names that are part of non-simple request

# 41.4 Full-Stack Workflow

- Inside-out: Starts from backend, fully implements feature for lyaer before making changes to layers above it
- Outside-In: starts from frontend, fuly implements small part of feature through layer of architecture

- Inside out:
  - data -> application -> presentation
  - changes to data are made early, business requirements early
  - UI for end
  - might have accidental features/overlook UI
  - feedback delayed, frontend rushed

- Outside-in
  - small vertical slices, presentation -> app-> data
  - early feedback
  - unlikely for accidental features
  - user needs
  - backend may be rushed
  - delayed business clarification
