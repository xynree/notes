# Module 9 (Advanced Functions)

#  9.2 - Fucntion Expressions and Arrow Functions

Function Expression: function created in a place where trhere would otherwise be a value
Anonymous Function: unnamed function
Arrow Syntax: way of writing a compact function expression

- Function declaration 

    - fucntion declaration: function name() {}
    - function expression: const rating = function name() {}
    - anonymous function expression: const rating = function(){}

- Arrow functions

    - if only one parameter, parantheses is optional: const name = parameter => {}
    - if single return statement, can omit brackets

# 9.3 Higheroorder Functions

    - callback function: function passed into another function as an argument
    - higher oder function: a function that returns another function
    - const discountedPrice = discount => price => price * discount
        - concise syntax
    - forEach()
        - accepts a function as an argument, runs once for each element of the array
        - simplified for loop
        - also gives other arguments to use in the function, index and collection

# 9.4 - Find, filter, map, some, and every

Find: decides whether an item matches and returns first item that matches the condition. If no match, returns undef.

    - let found = parks.find((park) => park.name === name)
        - return found;

Filter: Builds a new array only of items that match a certain condition

    - let result = parks.filter((park) => park.rating > 4))
    - console.log(result) => [{}, {}, {}]
    - returns a new array, does not mutate


Map: processes each item in the array with a function and then creates a new array with the altered values.

    - let result = parks.map((park) => park.name)
    - return result (["klsj", "sfkldj"])

Some: Returns True or False if any of array objects meet a comparison
    -  const result = parks.some((park) => park.rating > 4))
    -  return result --> true

Every: Returns true or false if EVERY item in an array meets some condition
    - same as some (but for all)

- Don't forget to return! 
    - in order for map, filter, etc to work, changed value must be returned to add to array

# 9.5 - Reduce

- Generalizes the accumulator pattern
- each step of loop gets one item for array and combines it with an accumulator

- let result = areas.reduce((total,arrayItem) => total + arrayItem))
- value of area is added to total at every step
- make sure to return the result so that function "recycles" the initial item
- 2nd optional value can be passed to reduce to use as starting value.

# 9.6 Sort

- takes callback and uses it to sort n a array based on criteria
- If returned number negative, first item moved behind second, if positive it moves ahead. If 0 items do not change places
- ternary operator works or parkb - parka for quick comparison works
- sorting strings:
    - you can compare strings with > and < symbols
    - based on character values, so uppercase and lowercase sorts don't work, but can toLowerCase strings to equalize them if needed
- Caveats:
    - mutates existing array
    - It has a default behavior which may not be what you want
