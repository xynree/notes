# 7.5 Environment Variables and Script Arguments
    - env var: a key-value pair held by OS and user
    - script/command line program/command line script: program run on command line
    - coding environment in command line: REPL
    - running env will print global environme nt variables

        - process.env has environment varaibles in the system
    - set temporary env variables: process.env.NODE_ENV
    - script arguments: arguments in command line

# 7.6 modules
    - local modules: exports an object or function
        - module.exports = nameOfFunction
    - when importing:
        - let import = require('./nameOfFunction')
        - "import" can be any name
    - if you require a file that is not exported with modules.export you will receive an empty object.
    - export an object inside a function:   
        - module.exports = { findPlant: findPlant };
        - let plantFunctions = require('./plants');
            - console.log(plantFunctions.findPlant())
