# Module 2 (Notes)

# 2.2 / 2.3

Key Terms:

REPL: Read-eval-print loop, interactive programming environment
Operator: Symbol that performs and operation on an operand and give result
Mathematical Operator: operator that performs arithmetic calculation
Assignent Operator: operator that assigns specific values
Variable: named container that stores changeable data value
Function: block of code that describes repeatable process or behavior


Concepts:

Camel Casing, Grammer and Syntax in JS, Overwriting variables, Comments

# 2.4

Terms:

Data Type: type of value variable can have: string, number, boolean
String: sequence of characters treated as text
Integer: int (whole number with no fraction or decimal)
Floating-point / float: number including decimal point
Boolean: true/false
Coercion: converting one data type to another

Concepts:

- typeof function to reveal data type (console.log(typeof "2")) returns string
- ! is not but also called bang
- if you add string and int JS will return a string
- parseInt() -> takes string returns int
- parseFloat() -> takes string returns float
- toString() -> int to string
- null vs undefined data types
    - typeof null returns 'object' 

# 2.5 - manipulate text

Key Terms:
Concatenation: merging 2 strings
Method: function attached to an object as an attribute

Concepts:
Finding length of string: "hello".length - delivers property of the string
Methods: 
    -toLowerCase(): all letters lowercased
    -toUpperCase(): all letters capital
    -trim(): removes whitespace
    -replace(): replaces part of string with another string
- Methods leave original string intact

# 2.6 - control flow

Key Terms
- Control Flow/Flow of Execution: conditionally determines which set of instructions run
- Conditional Statement: tells code to perform different tasks based on different info
- Order of Operators
- Truthy / Falsy
- Logical Operators: Operators that test whether a condition is met
- Comparison Operators: Math symbols comparing two values

Concepts:
    - Equality:
    - === as comparison operator. === is strict  comparison, == is soft comparison
    - Don't mix up assignment/equality
    - Relational Operators: < , >. >=. !==
    - Else if
    - Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
    - Order of Operators: PEMDAS
    - Truthy and Falsy:
        - Falsy:
        - false, '', 0, null, undefined, NaN
        - Everythinog else evaluates to true
    - !! will turn anything to a boolean
    - Short Circuiting:
        - && will stop early if first value is falsy
        - || will stop early if first value is truthy

# 2.7 - Collecting data with arrays

Key Terms
    - Javascript Array: A collection of ordered items
    - Mutation: A change in original data value
Concepts:
    -push(), pop(), length
    - Array methods mutate the array.

# 2.8 - Iterating through collections

- For Loop
    - (for (initialExpresson; condition; incrementExpression){
    loop body}

# 2.9 - Objects

- dot notation
- key value pairs
- bracket notation
- objects can be nested


# 2.10 Accumulator Pattern

- Pseudocode
- Accumulator Pattern: uses a loop to accumulate data
