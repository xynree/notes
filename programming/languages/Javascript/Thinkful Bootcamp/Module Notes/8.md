# Module 8 Notes

# 8.2 Error Types

    - reference error: variable referenced doesn't exist or can't be accessed
    - syntax error: some syntax is used incorrectly
    - type error: misused a data type
    - silent: error doesn't surface immediately when code is run

# 8.3: Variables

    - let: declares variables in JS
    - cannot be redefined again with let
    - var: able to redefine again
    - const: can't reassign the value to a different type
        - can change values inside objects and arrays

# 8.4: Strings

    - template literal: JS feature
    - bracket notation to access chars in string
    - substr(): substr(index of first character to include in substring, num of charactgers to extract)
        - let first = sentence.substr(0,1)
    - split() method
    - join()
    - Escaping strings: \this part is part of string\ 

# 8.5: Control Flow

    - simplify if statements:
        - if (product.on/Sale) price = price*0.9;
    - ternary
    - switch

# 8.6: Looping Over Objects

    - Object.values(), Object.keys()
    - for (in) loop to access every key and value in an object
    - for (let name in people) {}
        - it's like a forEach loop for objects

# 8.10 default parametere

    - set default parameters like this function lsdkfj(default = 0){}
    - defaults can be destructured and equal to empty object or array

# 8.11 References

    - primitive data type: data type with variables that store values
    - reference data type/complex data type: data type containing variables that store addrresses to locations in memory
    - primitive data types are passed by value - when assigned to variable, variable gets its own copy of the data
    - reference data types: functions, objects, array
        - when assigned to a variable, the variable contains a reference to the data.
        - if you modify object through one variable, the other will have the same modification
    - empty objects do not equal each other because they store references to different empty objects

# 8.12 Writing Readable Code

    - Guard clause: statement evaulating to a boolean that determines whether or not function should keep going
    - Return early: write functions that terminate or throw an error as soon as something is run
        - if (!id) return 'did not run' ('guard clause')
    - Avoid explicit boolean returns
        - AVOID: return true, return false
        - instead return the whole test clause
