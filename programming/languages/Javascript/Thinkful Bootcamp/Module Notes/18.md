# 18.5: Requests in Javascript 

- axios library
    - returns a promise
        - axios.get(url).then((response) => {}))
            - response.status, response.statusText, response.data: return info about the status code, the status code message and the response body.
        - if an error occurs you can use catch() like with other promises.
    - complex requests
        - get(), post(), put(), patch(), delete()
        - second argument is a config object with info like headers or request body:
            - axios.post(url, { name: "", meaning:''}
