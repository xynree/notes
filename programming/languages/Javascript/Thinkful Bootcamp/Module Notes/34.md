# Node and Express Notes

__34.2 Project Configuration__
- Express: minimalist web framework for Node

File structure:
    - src -> app.js , server.js
        - src: holds code related to running the server
        - app.js: configures express app
        - server.js: runs express app

The server file (server.js):
    - Allows server to listen on a specified port
    - app.listen(PORT,listener)
        - Port = port set by process.env or explicit
        - listener = function to run when server is successfully run

use node src/server.js to run
- in package.json set up script for this to use npm start

- Nodemon
    - Watches for any changes that hapen to server and reloads for you
        - save a a dev dependency
        - instead of node server.js, run nodemon server.js

__Middleware__

- Middleware: A function that express server runs between receiving a request and responding to that request
    - helps manage request and can determine how server responds
- Middleware represented through functions:
    - const middleware = (req, res, nex) => {}
    - callback functions
    - req = request, res = response, next = when called, will go to next piece of middleware
- Attach middleware using app.use(function).
- Morgan package - used as middleware and will replace logging

__Error Handling__

- If route is non-existent, Express will run over all routes and then run the leftover middleware route.

    ``` app.use((req,res,next) => { res.send (`The route ${req.path} does not exist`}````

- Error Handlers
    - same as regular middleway except it has err parameter as first param
        - only gets called when there is a problem or it is triggered with next() function in a middleware app


__Router-level Middleware__

- simplify code by placing functions inside your router:

app.get(
  "/states/:abbreviation",
  checkForAbbreviationLength,
  (req, res, next) => {
    res.send(`${req.params.abbreviation} is a nice state, I'd like to visit.`);
  }
);


- Order of operations
    - Express receives request
    - App level middleware (morgan) runs
    - Express finds a matching route
    - Calls next middleware function which calls next() with arguments
    - Route function is now called.
