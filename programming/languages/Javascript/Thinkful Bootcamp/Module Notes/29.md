# React Router

Benefits of frontend navigation:
    - bookmark pages
    - share links
    - move back/forward in browsing history
    - faster than backend routing
    - smooth transitions/animations are easier
    - breaking up code

Router component
- Wrap App with Router component
- then use route components to render or hide components based on URL

- Wrap components with Route - if URL matches path property of route, component rendered
- path property can be a url path or array o furl paths: ['/about', '/contact']

<Router>
    <div>
    <Route exact={true} path='/'>
        <Home />
    </Route?
    </div>
</Router>

- exact property set to true - matches url path exactly

<Switch>
- Switch renders the first  child Route component that has a match.

<Link>
Use instead of <a> tags.
<Link to='/about'>About</Link>

<NoMatch>
- no match component only for when no other routes are matched.
- useLocation() -> returns the location object that represents the current url.
    - {location.pathname} -> gets current path
