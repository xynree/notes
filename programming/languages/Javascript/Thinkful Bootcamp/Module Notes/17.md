# 17 - Promises

# 17.2: Sync and Async Code

    - setTimeout as an asynchronous function

Event Loop
    - JS prioritizes certain lines for execution
    - Asynch code is in a queue that will always run after synchronous code executes
    - Add a callback function onto setTimeout to run some action after asynchronouse work is ready

# 17.3 - Creating Promises

    - promise runs asynch code and provides methods allowing to extract results from code

    - fs.readFile() asynchronous file
        - fs.readFile('./f.txt', (error, buffer) => {})

- Promises: an object that wraps around asynchronous code
    - Won't run callback function until  needed
    - 3 States:
        - Pending: promise first created
        - Fulfilled: finished running
        - Rejected: something failed
    - Syntax:
        - const newPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject)) => {})
        - resolve: fulfilled
        - reject: rejected
    - Promise changes state when resolve() or reject() is called

# 17.4 - Resolving Promises

- Promises use callback functions to signal state of the promise
- When resolved, callback function passed to .then()
- When rejected, .catch() method called
- welcomePromise.then((result) => {console.log()))
    - welcome().then((result)=>{})
- All work on result of promise must be done inside a then() function
- You can use variables outside of the promise in .then.
- catch(): error handler
- State changes from Pending -> Rejected: skips over any then() to next catch() method
- Chaining then() and catch()
    - Value returned from a then() callback is passed to the next then() callback.
    - If a then() callback returns a promise, the promise is resolved before the next then() is called
    - chain .then().then().then() to use promises and results
    - if you want to combine 2 promises: .then(() => goodbye().then =>)) inside a then block.

- Promises
    - has a .resolve and .reject method
    - .resolve is what is sent from promise.
    - Promise.then((result)=> ()) is used to handle the resolved value
    - if there is an error (.reject instead of .resolve), .catch() is run instead.
    - You can chain methods on the .then function
    - If you want to call more promises inside .then and use the results of more than one at a time, call the .then inside the other .then function
    - Otherwise you can use: .then().then().then() etc.
