# Module 13 : Collaboration with Github

# 13.2 - Branches

    - branch: collection of ordered commits
    - git branch command
        - common convention: initials with two dashes then branch name
    - git checkout
    - git checkout - : shortcut to last visited branch
    - git merge - should merge from the main branch if you want main branch to have to commits

# 13.3 - Feature Branch Workflower and Pull Requests
    
    - Feature Branch Workflow
        - create new feature branch from main
        - commmit new features
        - push branches up to github
        - create pull request to have it reviewed
        - after making any requested changes, merge the pull request, bringing new commits into main
    
    - pushes branch up to a remote branch on github and create pull, then the pull allows another person to review the code
    - To invite collaborator: Options => Manage Access
    - to push feature branch up: git push origin <branchname>
        - Click compare and pull request
    - Four tabs on pull request:
        - Conversation: comments
        - Commits
        - Checks: for automated builds/testing
        - Files Changed
            - Can add comments using blue comment +
