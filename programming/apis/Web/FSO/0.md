        - elements tab changes style
    - Loading a Page with JS
        - Order:
            - browser fetches HTML using GET
            - HTML fetches CSS
            - HTML fetches JS
            - Browser executes JS
                - Code makes GET req to server which returns JSON notes
            - Event handler runs to render notes to page

        - submitting form in notes creates a post
            - server: 302 (redirect)
    - Traditional vs SPA's:
        - Traditional: all logic on server, browser just renders HTML
        - SPA: only one HTML fetched, contents are excecuted in/using browser through JS
