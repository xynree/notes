# Full Stack Open / Part 3


## Node.js And Express

- NodeJS: JS runtime based on Google's V8 Engine
- Browsers don't support newest features of JS - code gets transpiled with libraries like Babel.
- npm init will generate a package.json
    - to start running node on index:
        - scripts: {
        "start": "node index.js"}
        (will run with npm start)

```simple web server
const http = require('http')

const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
  response.end('Hello World')
})

const PORT = 3001
app.listen(PORT)
console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)

```

- const http = require('http')
    - imports Node's web server module
    - Node does not support ES6 module syntax
- createServer method on http module creates a new web server
    - event handler attached to it

# Express
    - easier than node's server
    - npm install express
    - ^4.17.1  (caret  - if dependencies are updated, version of express installed is at least 4.17.1
        - installed version can also be a larger patch number or larger minor number (first must be the same)
    - update dependencies with npm update

    - define 2 routes - answered by using the send method of the response object
    - app.get('/api/notes', (request, response) =>{
    response.json(notes)})
        - respond with the json method of respond object
        - will set notes to a json formatted string

# Nodemon

- nodemon restarts node application if any changes detected
    - yarn add --save-dev nodemon
    - dev dependencies are only needed during dev of application, not needed in production mode
    - nodemon index.js

# REST
    
- architectural style for writing web apps
- RESTful API's
    - operations executed using HTTP verbs: get, post, delete put, patch
- Fetchign a single Resource
    -```defining parameters in url
        app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = request.params.id
  const note = notes.find(note => note.id === id)
  response.json(note)
})
```
    - Number(request.params.id) converts a string ('1') into a num (1)
    - error handling:
        app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
  const id = request.params.id
  const note = notes.find(note => note.id === id)
  response.json(note)
})

# API Testing 

- Postman
    - ionstall and use postman for testing tapis

- VSCode Rest Client 
    - Rest Client Plugin
        - make directory 'requests'
            - place requests in there as *.rest
            - running 'send request' will give a response from server

- Webstorm HTTP
    - Also uses .rest extensions


# Receiving Data

    - make HTTP POST request and send info for new not in the request body of JSON format.
        - express json-parser
            - app.use(express.json())
                - takes body property and turns into JS object before route handler called
        - make sure to set catch cases (if !body.content => return response.status(400).json({error: 'content missing'})
        - if setting timestamps, set up on server rather than browser
        -
