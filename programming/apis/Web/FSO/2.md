C) Getting Data From The Server

    - using JSON server
        - install -g json-server
        - npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json
            - defines an alternate port bc CRA uses localhost 3000
            - db.json with 'notes' JSON object can be seen at localhost:3001/notes


- The Browser As Runtime Environment

    - XMLHTTPRequest: HTTP Request Using XHR Object (Older version)
        - event handler registered to xhttp object: called whenever state of xhttp changes. 
            - jAsynchronous
    - Fetch Method is current
    - JS runtimes are asynchronous 0 sometime after an asynch operation is completed, JS engine calls event handlers
        - single threaded - cannot execute code in parallel
        - web workers can help run parallelized code
        - event loop of one browser is still just single threaded 


- npm

    - Could use Fetch - use axios for this tutorial instead
        - yarn install axios
    - npm will auto include dependencies
        - npm install json-server --save-dev
        - npm run server
            - saving as dependency: for developmennt. program does not require json-server to execute


- Axios & Promises

- import axios from 'axios'
  
  const promise = axios.get('localhost/notes')

    * for fast refresh:
        in .env:
        - FAST_REFRESH=false

    - get method returns a promise:
        - object representing eventual completion/failure of asynch operation
        - Three states:
            - Pending
            - Fulfilled
            - Rejected
    - to access result of operation use 'then':
        - promise.then(response => {})
        - response object has all data related to response of GET object: data, status code, headers


- Effect-Hooks
    
    - Effect Hooks allow you to perform side effects in function components
        - set up get request in useEffect hook
            - Effect order:
                - body of function defining component is rendered - calls log once
                - then useEffect hook runs & gets data : logs again
    - refactor: useEffect(hook, [])

- The Development Runtime Environment

    - react dev server calls JS code + minifies everything
    - react calls json-server

D) Altering Data in Server

- REST conventions
    - routes: URL/HTTP request types
- REST
    - individual data objects: resources
        - resources have URL address associated with it
        - fetched with HTTP GET
        - creating new: HTTP POST
            - data for new note: request.body
    - json-server requires JSON format
        - request: content-type: application/json

- Sending Data to the Server
    - axios.post('...', noteObject).then()
        - let server generate id values
    - update state after post using useState.
    - make sure to make a copy when changing state. 
    - can use map to check if id needs to be added to the state array.

- Extracting Communication with Backend into Separate /Module
    - src/services/notes.js
        - return an object with three functions (get, create, update)
        - then import it in to use CRUD
        - .then method returns a promise

- Cleaner Syntax for Object Literals
    - export default {getAll, create, update} (destructuring)

- Promises and Errors
    - .catch method called if request failed
        .catch(error => {
        console.log('fail')})
