# Latency vs Throughput

- Latency: Time required to perform an action
  - Measured in units of time (hours, mins, secs)
- Throughput: The number of actions or results produced PER UNIT of time
  - Measured in units of what's being produced per unit of time: "5 cars / hr"

- Generally we should aim for maximum throughput with acceptable latency:
  - ELI5: Aim for the most actions possible at once at just a normal speed.
