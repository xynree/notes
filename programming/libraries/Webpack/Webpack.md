# Webpack

## Pt 1

- webpack bundles dependencies & combines into HTML/CSS/JS

- npm run dev
    - main.chunk.js
        - big file of all js files combined together + CSS in JS
- npm run build
    - all files minified and separate CSS files made/combined into CSS

## Pt 2

- DIY version:
    - alert service + component service + a run function to run both + set up dependencies in order
- Using Webpack
    - npm init
    -.git ignore
        -node modules
    - npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
