# Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information

- Binary digits/bits are stored as two valued symbols
- Base-10 representation has been in use for >1000 years
  - Developed in India
  - Brought to West in 13th ct by Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)
- Binary Values good for processing info (punch card, low voltage, magnetics)
- Three most important representations of numbers
  - Unsigned encoding: Traditional binary notation
  - Two's complement incoding: signed integers (pos or neg)
  - Floating point encodings: base-2 scientific notation for real numbers
- Limited number of bits when large, though integer arithmetic is predictable
- Differences in how they handle finiteness
  - Integer: Small range of values, but precise
  - Floating-point: Wide range of values, but approximate
- Understand range of values to be represented and properties of different operations
  - Hacking, exploiting computer arithmetic!
- Bit level representations of numbers: Understand machine level code generated by compilers
- We will define encodings, and then derive ranges, bit level representations, and properties of arithmetic operations
