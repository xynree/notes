# 2.1 Information Storage

- Computers use blocks of 8 bits (bytes) as smallest unit of memory
- Machine level program views memory as large array of bytes `virtual memory`, identified by its unique `address`
  - Set of all possible addresses = `virtual address space` (conceptual image presnted by machine-level program)
  - Actual implementation uses combination of RAM, memory, disk storage hardware, and OS software to provide this mirage

> ## The Evolution of the C Programming Language
>
> C was first developed by Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs for use with Unix  
> Most system programs were written in assembly code at the time  
> Original Bell Labs version documented in 1st ed of Brian Kernighan + Dennis Ritchie book  
> Over time - evolved through standardization groups  
> ANSI C standard 1989, ANSI C 1990 (ISO C90), 1999 ISO C99, 2011 ISO C11. Most additions are backwards compatible  
> `gcc` can compile according to specified concvention, `-ansi`, `-std=c99`, `-std=c89`

> ## The role of pointers in C
>
> - Mechanism for referencing elements of data structures  
> - Pointer has 2 aspects: `value`, `type`
> - Value = location of object
> - Type = kind of object (int or float)

## 2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation

- A single byte = 8 bits
  - Binary notation: Value ranges from 0000000000 to 11111111
  - Decimal integer ranges from 0 base 10 to 255 base 10.
  - Hexidecimal notation is base-16 instead, using digits 0 -> 9 and A -> F to represent 16 possible values
    - Value of single byte ranges from 00 v16 to FF v 16

- in C, constants starting with `0x` or `0X` are hexadecimal
- Common task with machine-level programs: converting between decimal, binary and hex representations of bit patterns
  - Binary <-> Hexadecimal straightforward (see chart above)
    - Can memorize decimal equivalents of hex digits `A,C,F`(10, 12, 15). Hex values `B, D, E` can be translated by computing values relative to first three

- Given Binary number, convert to hexadecimal by splitting into groups of 4 bits each.

## 2.1.2 Data Sizes

- Every computer has a `word size` : nominal size of pointer data
  - Determines the maximum size of the virtual address space
  - Virtual address space at most 2^w bytes
- Scaling to 64-bit word size leades to a virtual address space of 16 `exabytes`
- Distinction is in how a program is compiled, rather than type of machine it is running on (32 vs 64-bit programs)
- Exact number of bytes for some data types depend on how program is compiled

- Integer Data can be signed or unsigned
  - Signed: represent neg, zero, and positive values
  - Unsigned: only non-negative values
- `int` usually 4 bytes
- `long` usually 32 bytes in 32 bit programs, 8 bytes in 64 bit programs
- Standardized class of data types where data sizes are fixed regardless of ocmpiler/machine settings
  - int32_t & int64_t (4 / 8 bytes)
  - Using fixed-size integer types is best way for programmers to have close control over data representations
- Most data types encode signed values unless otherwise prefixed, except `char`
  - Programmer should use `signed char` to guarantee a 1-byte signed value
- Many different ways to call signed/unisigned values
- A pointer uses the full word size of a program
- Float/Double have single precision and double precision - 4 & 8 bytes
- Portability - making programs insensitive to exact sizes of data types
  - Issues have occured with assuming 32-bit word size dependencies in transition to 64-bit machines

## 2.1.3 Addressing and Byte Ordering

- Establish two conventions for programs that span multiple bytes:
  - Address of object
  - How to order bytes in memory
- Multi-byte object usually stored as a contiguous sequence of bytes
- Address given by the smallest address of the bytes used
- Two conventions for ordering bytes representing an object
  - Ordered from least significant to most (little endian)
  - Most to least (big endian)
    - Most intel machines are little-endian
- Some chips are `bi-endian` , can be configured to be either
- ARM is `bi-endian` but Apple and Android use little endian
- When does byte ordering become an issue?
  - When binary data communicated over a network between machines
  - Code for network apps must follow established conventions for byte ordering
  - When looking at byte sequences representing integer data
  - When programs are written that circument normal type system (casting or union types)
- C `size of operator` determine # of bytes used by object

## 2.1.4 Representing Strings
- Strings in C are array of char terminated by null value character
- Character represented by ASCII codes
- byte length is string length + 1 for the null terminator
- Text data is more platform independent than binary data bc. mostly all use ASCII

## 2.1.5 Representing Code

> ## The Unicode Standard for Text Encoding
>
> How to encode for different languages? Unicode Consortium has most widely accepted standard. Unicode standard
> Base encoding uses 32-bit representations
> UTF-8 encodes each character as a sequence of bytes (1 - 4 bytes per character)

- A program from perspective of machine is just a sequence of bytes.

## 2.1.6 Intro to Boolean Algebra
- George Boole (1815-1864): Math around 0 and 1 logic.
  - By encoding true/false as 1 and 0, could formulate algebra that captures principles of logic.

- Boolean `~` = logical `NOT`
- Boolean `&` = logical `AND` (^)
- Boolean `|` = logical `OR` (v)
- Boolean `^` = Exclusive-Or. When one is true but not both

- Claude Shannon (Founder of field of information theory) made connection between boolean algebra and digital logic in electromechanical relays
- Extend 4 Bool operations to operate of `bit vectors` - strings of zeros and ones of fixed length `w`.

## 2.1.7 Bit-Level Operations in C
- Bitwise Bool operations supported in C
- Expand hexademical to binary, perform operations, then convert back to hex

## 2.1.8 Logical Operations in C
- ||, &&, and ! = `OR`, `AND`, `NOT`
- Logical operations treat any nonzero argument as `TRUE` and argument 0 as `FALSE`
- Logical operators don't evaluate their second arg if the result can be determined from the first arg
  
## 2.1.9 Shift Operations in C
- Shift operations are for shifting bit patterns to the left and right.
- `<<` `>>` x `<<` : x is shifted `k` bits to the left, dropping of fthe `k ` most significant bits and filling the right end with ` k zeros`
- Right shift: x >> k
  - Logical: fills the left end with `k` zeroes
  - Arithmetic - fills the left end with `k` repititions of the most significant bit
- Addition / Subtraction have higher precendence than shifts.
