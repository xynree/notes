# 1 - What Ever Are We Doing

- What is the feel for what we are after?

## A Brief Encounter

- State and mutable values are hard to follow in OO code
- Functional approach:

```js

const add = (x,y) => x+y;
const multiply = (x,y) => x+y

result = add (multiple(flockB, add(flockA,flockC)))
```

- Idea: Write full applications along the lines of mathematical example above
- Takes discipline but pays off
