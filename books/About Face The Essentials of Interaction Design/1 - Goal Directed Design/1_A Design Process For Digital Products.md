# 1 - A Design Process For Digital Products

- If we design & develop digital products so people who use them can achieve their goals, they will be happy :)
- Design: Conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order
  - Understanding desires, need, motivations, and contexts of users
  - Understanding business, technical, and domain opportunities
  - Using knowledge as foundation for plans to create products that are useful, usable, desirable, and feasible

## Consequences of Poor Product Behavior

- Digital products are rude
  - Blame users for making mistakes that aren't their fault
  - Interrogate users
- Require people to think like computers
  - Assume people are technology literate
  - Hide meaning, intentions, and actions from users
- Have sloppy habits
  - Makes us step out of the flow of tasks to do things that shouldn't require separate interfaces or extra navigation to access
- Require humans do the heavy lifting
  - Manually copying, pasting, pulling windows and widgets around on screen

## Why Digital Products Fail

- Companies end up creating solutions that are difficult to use and control
  - Misplaced priorities
    - Need to take in account user's goals, needs, motivations
    - Poor product vision = products that irritate rather than please
    - Core design process should precede coding and testing
  - Ignorance about real users and needs
    - How to make users happy? How will they actually use product?
  - Conflicts of Interest (when dev teams do both designing and building UI)
    - Ease of coding is a conflict of interest
    - Isn't possible for developer to advocate effectively for user, business, and technology all at the same time
  - Lack of a design process
    - Repeateable, predictable, and analytical process for ensuring _desirability_
    - Confusing domain knowledge with design knowledge: Customers often cannot visualize solution to problems

## Planning and Designing Product Behavior

- Requires upfront effort by professional designers
- Design was introduced to consumer products as a means to increase desire for product
- Conscious inclusion of design = triad of product development concerns
  - Capability
  - Viability
  - Desirability
- Design of behavior is a problem that requires greater knowledge of context
  - Most important: Understanding how user wants to use products

## Recognizing User Goals

- Often different from what we guess
- UI often fail to meet user goals:
  - Make users feel stupid, cause them to make mistakes, require too much effort to operate, not engaging or enjoyable

## Goals versus tasks and activities

- Goals are not the same as tasks or activities
  - Goal is expectation
  - Activities/tasks are steps
- Hierarchy
  - Activities -> Tasks -> Actions -> Opertaions (ACD Activity-Centered Design). Focus on understanding human activities
  - Activity Theory - Soviet-era theory of psychology: understanding who people are by how they interact with the world
- Does not seem to ask _why?_ just _what?_
- Understanding goals allows you to understand expectations and aspirations
- Easy way to tell difference between goals and tasks: Goals change very slowly over time
- Designing based solely on understanding activies or tasks can trap design in outdated models or not meeting the user's goals

## Designing to Meet Goals in Context

- Good design makes users more effective
- Universal human goal of not looking stupid
- Software that helps users perform tasks without addressing goals does not help them be truly effective

## Implementation Models and Mental Models

- Computer Literacy = forcing humans to understand application logic, rather than having software stretch to meet people's usual ways of thinking
- Implementation Models
  - Computers use algorithms and modules of code to communicate (system/implementation model)
  - Easy to design software that reflects implementation model
- Mental Models
  - User has conceptual model of how it works. Cognitive shorthand that covers interactions with product, but doesn't cover inner mechanics
- Striving toward Perfection: Represented Models
  - Software presents a behavioral face that is created by developer/designer
  - Represented model: How the designer chooses to represent an application's functioning to the user (Designer's model)

- Mental models are simpler than reality, so represented models should be intermediary between implementation and mental.

## An Overview of Goal-Directed Design

- How to research properly?
- Most methods don't provide means of translating research into design solutions
- Bridging the Gap
  - Design provides true product definition, based on user goals, business needs, and tech restraints
  - Designers are researchers and need Dempathy
- Between research and blueprint: Models, requirements, frameworks
  - Designers often have to rely on third-person accounts of behaviors and desires
  - Methods generally provide info at task level, not useful for defining basic framework of what a product is, what is does, and how to meet needs
  - Need explicit, systematic process to bridge the gap

## Process Overview: Six Phases

### Research

- Observation/Contextual interviews
- Emergent set of behavior patterns suggesting goals and motivations
- Creation of Persons in Modeling phase to select and filter valid personas

### Modeling

- Synthesizing domain and user models
  - Using Information flow & workflow diagrmas
- User archetypes set up groupings of behaviors, attitudes, aptitudes, goals, and motivations (as boundaries)
- Iteratively generate design concepts in Framework Definition. Provides feedback that enforces design coherence and appropriateness

### Requirements

- Employs scenario-based design methods
- Each interface/persona gets analyzed in context scenarios, describing high level product touch points, and then defining detail at depths
- Requirements definition

### Framework Definition

- Overall product concept
- Interaction Framework using interaction design principles and interaction design patterns
- Outcome: Interaction Framework Definition
  - A balance of top-down design and bottom-up design
- Interaction designers and industrial desginers collaborate on input methods and form factors, drafting service map and blueprints
- Visual interface designers produce options for visual framework (Visual Language Strategy)

### Refinement

- Increasing Focus on Detail and Implementation
  - Task Coherence, Key Path Scenarios, Validation Scenarios
  - Detailed docuemntation of design blueprint

### Goals, not features, are the keys to product success
