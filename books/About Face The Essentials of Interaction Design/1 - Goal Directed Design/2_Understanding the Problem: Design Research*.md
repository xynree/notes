## 2 - Understanding the Problem: Design Research

- Outcomes of design effort judged by how successfully meets needs of users and organization
- Gathered via qualitative research techniques

## Qualitative versus Quantitative Data

- Quantitative Research = "how much"? "how many"
- Qualitative Research - what, how, and why
- Qualitative methods help understand:
  - behaviors, attitudes, aptitudes
  - technical business and environmental contexts (domain)
  - vocabulary
  - how existing products are used
- Helps progress designs:
  - Gives design teams credibility
  - Gives team common understanding of domain issues
  - Empowers management to make more informed decisions about design issues
- Can also provide business insights not revealed through traditional market research

- Strengths & Limitations of Quantitative Methods

- Market segmentation - determines what type of consumers are most receptive to products or marketing messages
- Classification systems better clarify data
- Understanding if someone wants to buy something !== Understanding what they want to do with it after buying
  - Good for identifying and quantifying market opportunties, bad for defining product that will capitalize on it

- Quantitive reserach can help direct design research
  - Data usage analystics help identify design problems that need solutions
- User research can inform market research

## Goal Directed Design Research

![-  Goal Directed Design Research Process](https://s2.loli.net/2022/09/28/S6puTaMnwzIQNGi.png)  

- Kickoff Meeting
  - Ask initial key questions
  - What is the product? Who uses it? What do users need most
  - Which customers/users most important?
  - What challenges do design and business face
  - Who is biggest competittors & and why
  - What literature to look at to familiarize ourselves with produce domain
  
- Literature Review
  - Review lit pertaining to product or domain
  - Internal domcuments (brand strategy, market research, user surveys)
  - Industry Reports
  - Web searches
  - Use as basis for developing questions to ask stakeholders and SME's
  
- Product/Prototype and Competitive Audits
  - Examine any existing version of prototype of a product and its chief competititors
  - Engage in expert review of current design and competitive interfaces
  - Compare each against interaction and visual design principles
  - Familiarizes team with strengths and limitations
  - General idea of product's functional scope
  
- Stakeholder Interviews
  - Designers must develop solutions without losing sight of business goals
  - Understand opportunities and constraints that are behind the design brief
  - "Design is a conversation with materials"
    - Must understand capabilities and limitations of the materials used to construct the product. Talk to people responsible for managing and building product
  - Stakeholder = anyone with authority and/or responsibility for product being designed
  - Execs, amngagers, product management, design, useability
  - Prelim product vision - harmonizsing perspectives with those of users and customers
  - Budget and schedule - scope of design effort
  - Technical constraints and opportunities
  - Business Drivers (what they are trying to accomplish)
  - Stakeholder's perceptions of users
  - Develop a vision entire team believes in
  - SHouldn't accept stakeholder perspectives at face value
  - People may express problems by trying to propose solutions. Root out real problems and propose appropriate solutions

- Subject Matter Expert Interviews (SME)
  - Authorities on the domain
  - Long experience with product means they have experience with certain interactions
  - Knowledgeable but not designers
  - Necessary in complex or specialized domains
  - Want SME expert throughout design process

- Customer/User Interviews
  - Customer: People who decide to purchase products. Often very different from user: executive or IT manager with distinct needs
  - Product must be viable
  - Customers often seldom use product themselves
