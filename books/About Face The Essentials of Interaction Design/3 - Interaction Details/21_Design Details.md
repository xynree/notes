# 21 - Controls and Dialogs

## Controls

- Self-contained screen objects through which people interact with the product
- 4 basic types:
  - Imperative controls (initiate a function)
  - Selection controls (select options or data)
  - Entry Controls: Enter Data
  - Display controls: Manipulate how app displays data

### Imperative Controls

- When we issuea a command, we specify the verb action
- When we describe what the action will affect, we specify the noun
- Control that corresponds to a verb is an imperative control because it commands action.
- Examples of imperative idioms: Menu Bar Controls, button

Buttons

- General if the control is rectangular with a rounded edge, it has the affordance of an imperative
- Executes as soon as it is tapped or clicked
- Default buttons are often highlighted to indicate the most common actions for a user
- Easily discoverable idiom
- Widespread use, has evolved with diversity across user interface
- Visually pliant: Indicates its pressability
  - Button control will change when hovered to indicate that it has been activated
  - Flat design may remove this pliancy, but can do so only because users have been trained to understand the button

Icon Buttons

- Toolbar with icon buttons has become a standard as familiar as a menu bar
- Changed from rectangular to square, and labels changed to icons
- Always visible and don't demand as much time or dexterity as a drop down
- Easy to memorize, especially in sovereign applicatins
- However, image on face of a button is not usually clear for a first time user
- Tooltips can help with deciphering icons

Hyperlinks

- Web convention of blue underlined text, providing a focus highlight color on mouseover
- Imperative control used for navigation
- Links now are used often in complex transactional websites like Amazon
- Images can also be used as links, however, they lack affordances
- Use links for navigtation through content, and buttons or icons but other actions and functions
- Common tactic for dialog boxes: provide a button for default choice and an adjacent hyperlink for the other option
  - This tactic could be seen as manipulative as it can obscure the hyperlink

### Selection Controls

- Imperative controls represent commands, they need objects (nouns) which to operate
- Selection and entry controls are used to define nouns
- Selection control allows user to choose this noun from a group of valid choices
- Also used to configure actions
- Traditionally, selection controls do not directly result in actions: instead they require an imperative control to activate
- In cases where it is desirable to allow user to make selections before commiting to an action, there should be an explicit control (button)
- In cases where users would benefit from seeing immediate impact and actions are easy to undo, selection controls can double as an imperative control
