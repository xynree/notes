# 18 - Designing for the Desktop

## Anatomy of a Desktop App

- The majority of work that is done on desktop apps is in sovereign applications
- Transient apps exist in supporting roles for brief, intermittent, and background tasks

### Primary and Secondary Windows

- Think of your application having a primary window and in many cases 1+ secondary windows
- Top level structure of desktop apps is the window: Movable, resizable container within contrent and fucntional controls reside

Primary Window

- Contains application content, expressed in the form of docs that can be created, edited, and shared
- Contains other objects with properties that can be manipulated and configured, or media that can be viewed or played
- Often divided into panes that contain content, a way to navigate between content, and sets of frequently used functions
- Designed to assume sovereign posture, filling most of the screen and supporting full-screen modes

Secondary windows

- Support primary window, providing access to less frequently used properties and functions, typically in `dialogs`
- Floating panels or palettes are also considered secondary windows

### Primary window structure

- Multiple functional areas:
  - Content or work area
  - Menu bar
  - Multiple toolbars, panels, palettes that help navigate or select content objects

Menus and Toolbars

- Collections of relaated actions a user can instruct application to perform
- Menus accessed by clicking on words arranged near top of screen
  - Often subject to standardization rules
- Toolbars are more specific:
  - Sometimes summoned through menus
  - present their functions as a collection of visual icons, sometimes with small labels

Content Panes

- Primary work area within most desktop applications
- Editable view of a form or document or a complex ontrol panel
- App typically has one primary content area
- Apps that support editing multiple documents or views of a document side by side may have multiple content panes

Index Panes

- Provide navigation andn access to docs or objects that ultimately appear inthe content view
- Sometimes used to select content display, other times drag-and drop used to add to content pane

Sidebars

- Allow object or document properties to be manipulated without modal or modeless dialogs
