# 17 - Integrating Visual Design

## Visual Art and Visual Design

- Have different purposes
  - Visual Art: Self-expression
  - Designers: Clear Communication
  
## The Elements of Visual Interface Design

- Concerned with treatment and arrangent of visual elements to communicate behavior and information
  - Every element has properties:
  - Capitalizes on ability to differentiate between objects by distinct visual appearance: creates richer meanings
- Content: Every design guideline is subject to context in which it is being used
- Shape: Primary way we recognize what an object is
  - Tend to recognize objects by outlines
  - Distinguishing shapes takes a higher level of attention
  - Not best property to contrast when purpose is for user attention
- Size
  - How big or small in relation to other items?
  - Size is an ordered and quantitative variable: automatically sequenced in terms of sizes and assigned quantities to those differences
    - We assume importance increases with size and weight
  - When something is very small or very large, can be difficult to deicpher other variable such as shape
- Color: Need to first take in account user goals, environment, content, and brand
- Value: How light or dark? Can be dissociative
  - People perceive value ocntrast quickly and easily
  - Also an ordered variable
- Hue: Multilayered associations by context
  - Should use a limited number of hues for an effective visual system
  - Don't forget about color blindness
- Saturation: Draws attention when there is strong contrast at play
  - Quantitative: greater saturation couples with higher vallues
  - Can be read as "loud" and cacophonous
- HSV in Combination: Be judicious in how contrast is used within these variables as well as how they relate across a palette
- Orientation: Up, down, sideways?
  - Useful when there is directional info to convey
  - Can be difficult to perceive with small sizes
  - Best as a secondary communication vector
- Texture: Rough/Smooth? Regular/uneven?
  - Not good for conveying differences or calling attention
  - Ridges of bumps on UI generally mean that it's draggable, and bevel or drop shadow makes buttons seem moe clickable
  - Small amounts of texture can even make minimalist design more learnable
- Position: relation to other elements in space
  - ORdered and quantitative
  - Leverage reading order to locate elements sequentially
    - Most important or first used elements in the top left
- Text and Typography
  - Critical components
  - Be careful to use text appropriately, because it has potentional to confuse/complicate
  - People recognize words primarily by shapes
    - All caps is harder to read than cased text
  - Recognizing words is also different from reading:
    - Reading is ok for content, but not okay for interfaces
    - Interfaces should minimize amount of text that must be read
- Design principle: Visually show what, textually tell which
  - Use high-contrast text (80%+)
  - appropriate typeface and size: crisp sans serif is best for readibility
  - Do not use type sizes < 10
  - Phrase text succintly
- Information Hierarchy
  - For transient apps, info hierarchy should be very apparent with strong contrasts between the levels of importance
  - For sovereign apps, info hierarchy can be more subtle
