# 8 - Digital Etiquette

- Humans treat and respond to computers/interactive products as if they were people
- Design products to behave as a likeable person

## Designing Considerate Products

- Considerate software has goals and needs of users as concern
- Interactions that are respectful, generous, ad helpful create a positive experience for people using product

### Take an Interest

- Cookies, etc remember info that users routinely enter.
- Work to remember habits
- Remembering actions/prefs one of the best ways to create positive experience

### Deferential

- Inconsiderate = supervise and pass judgement
- Software should submit to users

### Forthcoming

- A good sales associate will not only answer question but also volunteer useful collateral info
- Can take a delicate touch: don't be like Clippy

### Use Common Sense

- Don't offer inappropriate functions in inappropriate places
- Don't place controls for commonly used functions next to never-used controls
- Menus with harmless functions adjacent to important functions

### Use Discretion

- Keep private things unremembered: credit card nums, tax IDs ,passwords, etc.
- Should help users by helping choose secure passwords and reporting improprieties

### Anticipate people's needs

- Good systems can anticipate needs and prep for them while we are idle

### Conscientious

- Has larger perspective on what it means to perform a task

### Don't Burden You with Personal Problems

- Show interest in people who use it and keep quiet about its own problems
- Error messages, confirmation dialogs, notifiers
- Should have intelligence, confidence, and authority to fix its problems on its own

### Keep You Informed

- Software should inform us about things that matter to us

### Perceptive

- Observes what users are doing and uses those observations to offer relevant information
- Should watch our prefs and remember tham without being asked to do so

### Self-Confident
  
- Undelete works better than confirmation dialogs or "are you sure you want to print"

### Don't Ask a Lot of Questions

- Questions make people feel badgered and harrassed
- Provide choices rather than ask questions
- Ask fewer questions, provide choices without asking questions, and remember info that has already been learned appears smarter to users

### Know When to Bend the Rules

- Most computer systems have 2 states - nonexistence and full compliance, no intermediates
- Every manual system has another `suspense` state: Transaction can be accepted even though it is not fully processed
- `Fudgeability` : Allowing humans perform actions out of sequence or before prereqs are satisfied
- Fudgeable systems reduce the number of mistakes
- Considerate products need to realize and embrace fudging limits

### Responsibility

- Software should take responsibility for problems within its neighboring scopes

### Avoids awkward mistakes

- Digital products should help you realize where you are
  - Not with modals, but through visual and textual feedback

## Designing Smart Products

- Products that can work hard even when conditions are difficult and when users aren't busy

### Put Idle Cycles to Work

- Put effort into allowing software to work proactively when it is not busy reacting to the user
- Computer has enough spare power to make several assumptions and discard the results of the bad ones when the user finally makes their choice
- Options: offering previous searching choices, indexing in downtime, etc

### Smart Products have a Memory

- Retaining info during and between uses can be used to incfreate software's smarts from user perspective
- Predict what users will do: Give interface a memory
  - Self motivated assistant, remembring helpful info and personal prefs without needing to ask

### Smart Products Anticipate Needs

- Goals/how to achieve them is similar from day to day
- Pay closer attention to clusters of actions and group them

### Remember Details

- If it's worth it to user to do it, it's worht it to the application to remember it
- Everything users sdo should be remembered
  - App can give previous info as default, and let them change it if it is wrong

- Remembering File Locartions
  - File-open facilities should remember where the users gets his files
- Deducing Information
  - Software should remember both facts and userful info that can be deduced from these facts
- Multi-Session Undo
  - Saving and reloading undo stacks
- Past Data Entries
  - Better memory = reduces number of errors users make
  - Remember what user enters and use that info for future reasonableness checks
- Foreign app activities on app files
  - Apps can keep a small thread running between invocations to keep an eye on files it has worked on
  - Can be usful to user when he next runs application

## Making Smart Products Work

- Don't just pop up modals: Howe much should application remember/Which aspects should it remember? Characteristic patterns in how people make choices can help resolve complex questions about ask coherence

### Decision-set Reduction

- Reduce infinite set of choices to a small, finite set of choices
  - Software can take notice and act on it
- Remember more than just one previous choice
- Pieces of info to rmeember tend to come in groups
- Several options are correct - should be looking for clues to differentiate which one is correct

### Preference Thresholds

- Decisions fall into important and unimportant
- Asking users for successively detailed decisions about a procedure is unnecessary
- Make assumption about how many copies wanted or needed the first time and remember them for future
- Track which preferences are important and which are ignored
- App can offer choices where it has an expectation that user wwants to take control, not bothering him with unnecessary decisions

### Mostly right, most of the time

- If tasks are uncertain, use math ratios to figure out best choice - app should do what is most appropriate and allow users to override or undo if it allows them to avoid showing modals most of the time

## Designing Social PRoducts

- Sharing and Collaboration Features in software

### Know the difference between social and market norms

- Social: Rules of reciprocity afforded to friends and family
- Market: Rules afforded to people with whom one is doing business - fair price, honesty

- Know the norms in which its users operate
- Sofwate adhering to market norms should assure both parties that deal will be fair
- Social norms: help users adhere to subculture rules and hierarchy in recripocal ways

### Lets users present their best side

- How to represent users in social interfaces?
- User Identity
  - Let users provide a visual that works best for them
- Dyhamic vs static user profiles
  - Actions speak louder than self descriptions
  - User should have control of who gets to see info
- Permits easy collaboration
  - Google docs lets colloboraters reply directly. Apparent, useable, fit personas' collab needs and communications
- Know when to shut the door
  - Socialness should not overwhelm or distract from primary task
  - Should have access to a way to "shut the door" and suspend social interaction
- Help NEtworks Grow Organically
  - Must have ays for new emmbers to discover network, join, build  a presence, and interact
- Respect the Complexity of Social Circles
  - Dunbar's Number - 150 tribe # limit
  - Communities of practice - afford permissions depending on role and seniority

### Repsect others' privacy

- Make additional sharing a carefully explained, opt-in affair

### Deal appropriately with the anti=social

- Provide tools to silence trolls and report them to community caretakers
- Help caretakers distinguish trolls from those who are earnest but unpopular
