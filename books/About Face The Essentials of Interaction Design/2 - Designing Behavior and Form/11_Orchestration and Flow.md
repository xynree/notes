# 11 - Orchestration and Flow

## Flow and Transparency

- Design interactions to promote/enhance flow, avoid flow-disturbing behavior
- Directing attention to the interaction itself puts the emphasis on the side effects of tools rather than on user goals
  - Ultimate user interface is often no interface
- Interaction with software is transparent: good novelist makes craft invisible

## Orchestration

- Interaction designers must train to hear sour notes in orchestration of software interaction
- All elements in an interface need to work together coherently toward a goal

## Harmonious Interactions

- Follow user's mental models:  mind looks for a pattern of cause and effect to gain insight

### Less is more

- Strive to reduce # of elements in user interfaces without reducing capabilities of products
- Offer appropriate functionality based on user context
- When features are housed in separate dialog windows, not enough consideration for how people use functions together
- Minimalist approach to product design is tied to clear understanding of purpose
- Reduction is a balancing act requiring a good understanding of users' mental models

### Let users direct rather than discuss

- Ideal interaction is like using a tool, not a dialogue

### Provide choices rather than ask questions

### Keep necessary tools close: Palettes/toolbars and keyboard commands allow users to ensure that information about tools is clear and present

### Provide Modeless Feedback

- Whenever info for users is built inot the structures of interface and doesn't stop flow of activities and action

### Design for probable but anticipate possible

- Segregate the possible from the probable
- Dialog and options used many times should not be side by side with dialogs used once a year or never

### Contextualize information

- Especially quantitative or numeric info
- "Compared to what?": Show the data visually rather than telling about it extually or numerically

### Reflect object and application status: Best used with rich modeless feedback

### Avoid unnecessary reporting

- Show users when all is well and don't burden with how it was accomplished. Also don't show normalcy

### Avoid blank states

- Does a particular interaction move a person toward his goal?

### Differentiate between command configuration

- Big difference between configuring and invoking a function
- Generally, user invokes a command 10:1 to times he configures it
- Mkae user ask eplicitly for configuration once rather tha make user reject configuration 9 times out of 10.
- Place immediate access to functions on buttons in toolbars, and access to configuration user interfaces in menus.

### Hide Ejector Seat Levers

- Apps must have ejector seat levers so that users can move persistent objects or dramatically alter app function, behavior, or content
- Must ensure that users can never inadvertently fire ejector seat
  - type 1: Cause significant visual dislocation (changes in layout of tools and work areas)
  - type 2: cause irreversile action (More dangerous)
  - Should be hidden from inexperienced users

### Optimize for Responsiveness but accommodate latency

- Some interactions can be expensive latency-wise
- Implementation choices should provide user with little latency - accommodate choices that have been made and cannot be revisited
- Allow users to cancel operations causing latency
- Response time can be categorized in several buckets:
  - 0.1 : Response is instantaneous
  - <1 : Response system
  - <10 : Clearly notice that system is slow
  - >10 : Will lose user attention
    - Processes that take this long should be conducted offline or in the background
    - Status and progress should be clearly communicated, including estimated time remaining
    - Cancel mechanism is critical

## Motion, Timing, and Transitions

- Transitions allow mobile apps to appear responsive and immersive
- Motion helps express and illustrate relationships between objects (especially in mobile devices)
- Must always be used sparingly
- Should be used to support user's state of flow
  - Help focus attention in appropriate place
  - Show relationships between objects and actions
  - Maintain context during transitions between views or object states
  - provide perception of progress/activity
  - Create virtual space to guide users from state to state
  - Encourage immersion and engagement
- Animations should be short, sweet and responsive
- Should be meaningful to the context of the actual
- Should feel natural and smooth
