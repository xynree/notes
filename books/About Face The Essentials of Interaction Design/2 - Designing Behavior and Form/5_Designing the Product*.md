# 5 - Designing the PRoduct: Framework and REfinement

## Creating the Design Framework

- Stay at high level
- OVerall structure of user interface and associated behaviors
- Design Framework: OVerall structure of user's experience
  - Interaction Framework
    - Scenarios/requirements to create rough sketches of screens and behaviors
  - Visual Design Framework
    - visual language studies
  - Industrial Design framework
    - physical models
- Take a top-down approach, focus first on big picture
- Render solution in only enough detail to provoke engaged consideration
- Storyboards accompanied by narrative scenarios are effective in exploring/discussing design solutions
- Pencil-like sketches increased understanding of renders as = work in progress

## Defining the interaction framework

- This process occurs in iterative loops

### 1: Define form factor, posture, input ethods

- Form factor = what type of application and in what context?
- Posture: = how much attention devoted to interacting with product?
- Input method = how will users interact with product?

### 2: Define functional and data elements

- Revealed to user in the interface
- Data elements = subjects of interactive products
- Basic units to be referred to, responded to, and acted upon
- Should match mental models
- Function elements = operations that can be done to data elements and representations in interface

### 3: Determine functional groups and hierarchy

- Group elements to facilitate a persona's flow between a task and related tasks
