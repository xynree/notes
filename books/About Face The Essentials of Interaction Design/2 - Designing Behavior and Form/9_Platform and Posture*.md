# 9 - Platform and Posture

- platform: combination of hardware and software enabling function
- posture: behavioral stance: how it presents itself to users

## Product Platforms

- Common platforms:
  - Desktop
  - Websites/Web apps
  - Mobile devices
  - Kiosks
  - In-vehicle systems
  - Profressional devices
- Shorthand to describe important product features

## Product Postures

- Software applications should have a specific presentation that matches with their purpose
- Look and behavior should reflect how it is used rather than personal taste of designers, developers or stakeholders
- Look and feel is a behavioral choice

## Postures for the Desktop

### Sovereign Posture

- Monopolize Users' attention for long, continous periods of time
- Word Processors, Spreadsheets, Email applications
- Usually used maximaized

_Target Intermediate Users_

- Users are interested in progressing up learning curve to become intermediate users
- Optimized for use by intermediates
- If possible, satisfy infrequent users as well

_Be Generous with Screen Real Estate_

- Take up as much real estate as possible. No other app competing with yours
- Usually run maximized
- Needs to be fully resizeable but optimized for full-screen

_Minimum Visual Style_

- Take care to mute colors and textures of visual presentation
- Narrow and conservative color palette with small accents

_Provide rich visual feedback_

- Can productively add extra information to interface - status bars, title bar, indicators, hints for action.
  - Do not clutter up
- After a period of steady use, artifacts will start to get use. Richness adds to experience

_Support rich input_

- Keyboard shortcuts, direct manipulation, sensitive areas can be small.
- Use corners and edges for controls

_Design for Documents_

- Maximize document views within the application
- Child windows with documents should always be maximized unless user instructs otherwise
- Sovereigh apps create and view documents with rich data. If there is only a single, simple function, it has `Transient` posture

### Transient Posture

- Comes and goes, presenting a single function with a constrained set of controls
- Invoked when needed, appears, performs its job, then leaves, letting user continue normal activities
- Temporary nature
- UI should be obvious and helpful, controls clear and bold

_Make it Bright and Clear_

- Controls should be larger than those on sovereign app
- Should have instructions built into the surface
- May be seen infrequently and will forget meanings and implications of choices presented

_Keep it Simple_

- Keep user's attention on the window
- Don't force into supporting subwindows
- If transient app performs more than a single function, interface should communicate this unambiguously

_Remember User Choices_

- Use most recent size and placement in all applications

### Daemonic Posture

- Apps that normally do not interact with the user
- Serve quietly in the background. Manage processes
- Hiding/Showing daemonic icons when not needed / using control panels

## Postures For the Web

- Three basic categories: informational, transactional, web app

### Informational Websits

- Way to view shared and linked documents
- Ssequential/hierarchical sets of documents
- Consist of a navigation model to take users from one page to another plus search
- Exist today in the form of personal sites, marketing, support, and information centric
  - Wikipedia
- Biggest issue: Findability

### Transactional Websites

### Web Applications

- Heavily interactive, similar to robust desktop applications
- Examples: Google Docs, Facebook, Hulu

_Sovereign Web Applications_
