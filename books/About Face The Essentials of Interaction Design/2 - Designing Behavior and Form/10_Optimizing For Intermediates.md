# 10 - Optimizing for Intermediates

- How to address both beginning users and expert users with a single interface?

## Perpetual Intermediates

- Most users are intermediates, but bell curve is a snapshot of users across time
- Experts come and go but beginners change even more rapidly
- Beginners and experts tend over time to gravitate toward intermediacy
- Learning and improving are rewrading so beginners become intermediates very quickly or they drop out

- No one wants to remain a beginner
- Perpetual Intermediates: would like to learn more about product but usually don't have time

## Inflecting the Interface

- Beginner must find it easy to graduate into intermediacy
- Expert must not find runs obstructed for intermediates
- Doesn't cater to beginners or to experts but devotes the bulk of efforts to satisfying perpetuaal intermediates
- Inflection: Organizing interface to minimize typical navigation
  - Place most frequently desired functions and controls in the most immediate and convenient locations
  - Less frequent: pushed deeper in interface

### Commensurate Effort

- People are willing to work harder for something more valuable
- Users make commensurate effort if the rewards justify it
- Interface can't be complex for simple things but can be complex for complex results

### Progressive Disclosure

- Advanced or less frequently used controls are hidden in panes with expand/hide toggle controls
- Toggle usually sticky: once left open, stays that way
- Easy window into advanced features but allowed to stow away when not in use

### Organizing for Inflection

- Frequency of Use: How often controls,functions, objects or displays used in daily patterns of use
  - Most frequently used = immediately in reach
  - Less frequently used = no more than a click or two away
  - Other itmes: 2/3 away
  - Rarely Used: should be removed from everyday work space
- Degree of Dislocation
  - Sudden change in interface or in document/info being processed
  - Place these functions deeper into interface
- Degree of Risk Exposure
  - Fucntions that are irreversible or have other dangerous ramifications
  - Make these functions more difficult for users to stumble across

## Designing for Three Levels of Experience

- Rapidly and Painlessly move beginners into intermediacy
- Avoid putting obstacles in the way of intermediates whjo want to become experts
- Keep intermediates happy as they move around the middle

### What Beginners Need

- Very intelligent and very busy.
- Need some instruction but not very much, and process has to be rapid and targeted
- Help them understand why things work as they do
- If interface's represented model closely follows user's mental model, will provide understanding

#### Getting Beginners on board

- New user must grasp product's concept sna dscope quickly
- Ensure product adequately reflects the user's mental model of tasks
- Extra help provided will get in the way of intermediates: so help should not be fixed into the interface
- Guide facilities in dialog boxes are good for commmunicating scope, overview, and purpose

#### Beginners Across Platforms

- Same considerations apply to non-desktop products, but web apps, mobile apps etc. may not be accessed frequently enough to become familiar
- Make these interactions transparent and discoverable

### What Experts Need

- Their opinions have disproportionate effect on purchasing
- Set tone for product reviews and discussions, exerting influence
- Might look for esoteric features, demand faster access to regular working set of tools
  - Shortcuts to everything
- For specialized products: Optimize UX for experts
  - Development, creative authoring tools

### What Perpetual Intermediates Need

- Fast access to most common tools
- Don't need scope and purpose explained to them
- Know how to use reference materials
- Will automatically establish most used functions
  - Usually know advanced features exist - this is reassuring
- Apply bulk of attention to designing best interaction for most representative users: perpetual intermediates
