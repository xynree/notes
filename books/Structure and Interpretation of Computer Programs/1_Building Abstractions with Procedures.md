# Ch 1 - Building Abstractions with Procedures

- Computational Processes - maniplate data and evolves with programs
- Novice programmers must learn to understand and anticipate consequences of conjuring
- Well designed computational systems are modular, well structured and can be debugged.

## Programming in Lisp

- Invented in 50's as a formalism for reasoning about logical expressions - recursive equations
- Practical programming language
- Evolved informally and is now a family of disalects. This book uses Scheme
- Language has unique features that make it good of rstudying programming constructs and data structures
- Most significant - procedures can be represented and manipulated as data

## 1.1 The Elements of Programming

- Language = framework in which to organize ideas about processes
- 3 mechanisms:
  - Primitive Expressions (simplest entities)
  - Means of Combination (how compound elems are built from simpler ones)
  - Means of Abstraction (how compound elements are named and manipulated as units)
- 2 kinds of elements: Procedures and Data
  - Data = stuff we want to manipulate
  - Procedures = descriptions fo rules for manipulating data
- Powerful languages hould be able to describe primitive data and procedures and have methods for combining and abstracting both.
