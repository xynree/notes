# 13 - Chaining Functional Tools

- Chain - by combining functional tools together, build complex communications
- Tip: Make data - put things into an array and operate on whole array
- Tip: Take many small steps
- Tip: Replace coditionals with `filter()`
- Many standard libraries modify `map`, `filter`, `reduce` : Lodash, Clojure, Haskell
- `reduce` is good for building values
