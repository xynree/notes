# Introduction

## What's Haskell?

- Purely functional programming language
- Don't tell computer what to do but instead what stuff is - in the form of functions
- Immutable
- No side effects
- Functions will always return the same result when called with the same parameters
- Haskell is lazy: won't execute or calculate until it's forced to show result
- Allows to think of programs as tranformations of data
- Statically typed: Many errors are caught at compile time
- Has type inference: most types are inferred
- High level concepts that are elegant and concise
- Work on Haskell began in 1987, stable version released in 2003
