#  How Amazon S3 Works

    - Object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets
        - Object: file + metadata describing file
        - Bucket: container for objects
    - To store data, create a bucket and specify bucket name and AWS region. Then upload data as objects. Each object has a key, which is UID
    - Buckets/Objects are private and can only be accessed with excplicit permissions using bucket policies, IAM, ACL's and S3 Access Points.

## Buckets
    
    - A container for objects stored
        - ex: photos/puppy.jpg in EX-BUCKET in US West (Oregon):
            - accessable through URL: https://EX-BUCKET.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg. * accessing a bucket
    - When creating a bucket, enter bucket name and AWS region
        - cannot be renamed or zoned into a different region
            - must follow bucket naming rules

## Objects
    
    - stored in S3
    - object data + metadata
    - UID with a key(name) + version ID

## Keys
    
    - unique identifier for an object within a bucket
    - every object in bucket has 1 key
    - every object is addressed through web service endpoint, bucket name, key, + optionally version:
        - ex: puppy.jpg is the key.

## S3 Versioning

    - Versioning keeps multiple variatns of boject in a bucket

## Version ID
    
    - When S3 Versioning is enabled, S3 generates a unique version ID for each object

## Bucket Policy

    - IAM policy used to grant acess permisions
    - uses JSON-based access policylanguage

## ACLs

    - Used to grant read/write permissions to users for buckerts/objects

## S3 Access Points

    - named network endpoints. for manging access at scale

## Regions

    - geographical AWS region where Amazon S3 stores buckets you create.


# Data Consistency Moel

    - strong read-after-write consistency
    - updates to a single key are atomic and run in order, not at the same time

# Related Services

    - Can be used with other AWS stuff

    - Transfer Family

# Accessing Amazon S3

    - AWS Management Console
    - AwS CLI
    - AWS SDK
    - REST API
