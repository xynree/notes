# 6 - Enums and Pattern Matching

## 6.1 Defining an Enum

- Give a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values

```rust
enum IpAddrKind{
  V4,
  V6,
}
```

- Now `IpAddrKind` is a custom data type we can use elsewhere

### Enum Values

- We can create instances of enums:

`let four = IpAddrKind::V4;`

- We can defind a function that takes any `IpAddrKind` and call with both `V4` and `V6` variants
- Instead of calling an enum inside a struct, we can put data directly into enum variang

```rust
enum IpAddr {
  V4(String),
  V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from(".."));
```

- We can attach data to variant of enum directly
- V4() becomes a function call that takes a `String` argument and returns an instance of the `IpAddr` type
- Constructor function automatically defined by creating the enum
- Each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
  V4(u8,u8,u8,u8),
  V6(String),
}
let home = IpAddr::V4(127,0,0,1);
let loop = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

- You can put any kind of data inside an enum: strings, types, or structs, even other enums

```rust:enum-with-many-data-variants
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

- We can also define methods on enums with `impl`

### The `Option` Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Value

- `Option` type: value can be something or can be nothing
- Rust does not have nulls, but does have an enum that can encode concept of value being present or absent
  - `Option<T>`

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

- `<T>` is a generic type parameter: Can hold one piece of data of any type
- Each type that gets used in place of T chages the Option<T> to become a different type
- `Option<T>` differentiates between `T`, must be converted. This helps catch issues with null where you assume it isn't null when it actually is
- In order to use `Option<T>`, handle every variant
- `match` is a construct that manages this process

## 6.2 The `match` Control Flow Construct

- `match` allows you to compare a value against a seriew of patterns (like a switch case`)

```rust
enum Coin {
  Penny, Nickel, Dime, Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter => 25,
  }
}
```

### Patterns that Bind to Values'

- We can bind the parts of values that match the pattern

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum UsState {
  ...
}
 enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter(UsState)
 }

fn value-in-cents(coin:Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter(state) => {
      println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);})
      25
    }
  }
}
```

### Matching with `Option<T>`

- Compare the variants of `Option<T>` with match
- If there's a value inside `Option<i32>`, adds 1
- Iv no value, function should return the `Non` value

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
  match x {
    None => None,
    Some(i) => Some(i+1)
  }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plusone(None);
```

- `match` arms need to cover all possibilities.

### Catch-all Patterns and the _ Placeholder

- We can take special actions for aparticular values, but for others, take a default action

```rust
  let dice_roll = 9;
  match dice_roll {
      3 => add_fancy_hat(),
      7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
      other => move_player(other),
  }

  fn add_fancy_hat() {}
  fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
  fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
```

- `_` is a special pattern that matches any value but does not bind to the value
- We can't use `_` in a function, it is unused by default

```rust
  let dice_roll = 9;
  match dice_roll {
      3 => add_fancy_hat(),
      7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
      _ => reroll(),
  }

  fn add_fancy_hat() {}
  fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
  fn reroll() {}
```

## 6.3 Concise Control Flow with `if let`

- `if let` syntax combines `if` and `let` into a less verbose way

```rust
  let config_max = Some(3u8);
  match config_max {
      Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
      _ => (),
  }
```

```rust
  let config_max = Some(3u8);
  if let Some(max) = config_max {
      println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
  }
```

- `if let` takes a pattern and expression separated by an equal sign
- Syntactic sugar for a `match` that runs code when value matches one pattern, then ignores other values
- We can also add an `else` block: this is equivalent to the block of code that would go into the `_` case

```rust
    let mut count = 0;
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
    } else {
        count += 1;
    }
```
