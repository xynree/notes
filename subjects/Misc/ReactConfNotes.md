# React Conference


- React Keynote

    - Suspense:
        - Wraps your loading state around your components instead of defining loading state inside the component
            - integrated already in 16/17 with React.lazy
    - Concurrent features
        - adopt at your own pace
    - Server Components
        - Run only on server
        - directly access ss data
        - zero bundle size impact
    - server components previous available now
    - React Native not concurrent yet, synchronous + concurrent
        - landing next year, already rolled out in fb rn
